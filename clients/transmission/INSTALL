Recent Versions
---------------

This patch is made to add some missing features to Transmission (client version)

1. Get Transmission Source Archive from
   http://download.m0k.org/transmission/files/
   example : wget http://download.m0k.org/transmission/files/transmission-1.92.tar.bz2

2. Replace cli.c in folder cli and transmission.h in folder libtransmission.

3. Configure and Compile Transmission
   apt-get install intltool libevent-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
   ./configure --enable-cli --enable-daemon
   make
   strip cli/transmission-cli
   cp cli/transmission-cli /usr/local/bin/

Transmission 0.96 and later
---------------------------

1. Get the Transmission Source Code Release from
   http://www.transmissionbt.com/

2. Untar the package into a directory.

   tar -jxvf transmission-<version>.tar.bz2

3. Untar the tfb-package into a directory.

   tar -jxvf Transmission-<version>_tfCLI-<version>.tar.bz2

4. Copy the content of the tfb-package extracted in 3. to the
   Transmission-Directory extracted in 2. (overwriting files).
   
   Alternatively it is possible to use a patch against vanilla
   Transmission-Sources. to apply a patch cd to the 
   transmission-dir extracted from the archive and execute:
   
   patch -p1 < /path/to/tf-b4rt.patch

   FreeBSD only: Apply the patch "freebsd.patch" (file was just
                 copied to the Transmission-Directory)

5. Build + Install transmissioncli, instructions about how to
   do this can be found in the Transmission-Documentation.


Transmission 0.72
-----------------

1. Untar the package into a directory.

   tar -jxvf Transmission-0.72_tfCLI-svn3318.tar.bz2

2. Build + Install transmissioncli.
   Go to the directory just extracted and execute :

   ./configure --disable-gtk
   make
   make install
   
   Note: It may be called 'make' or 'gmake' depending on
         your system.
