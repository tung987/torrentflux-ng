/**********************************************************************
TorrentFlux-NG SUPPORT file
**********************************************************************/

	For support with your TorrentFlux-NG installation please see the
	forum:

		http://www.torrentflux-ng.org/forum/

	or the torrentflux-b4rt forum :

		http://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/forum/
		

	Please take the time to search the forum first for a solution to your
	problem.  If you still can't find the solution after searching, please
	leave a clear and concise subject/message:

	1.	Ensure the subject of your message takes the format:

			[VersionXXX] Description

		where:

			VersionXXX is the version of torrentflux-b4rt you are
			running
			- ie 1.0-beta3.

			and

			Description gives a concise description of your problem.
			A message with a subject of 'HELP!!!' is NOT a good subject
			and is likely to be ignored.

		For example, a good subject for a message would be something
		like:

		[1.0-beta3] Transfers fail to start when template
		caching enabled


	2.	Ensure the content of your message describes:

		a.	Your working environment if relevant

			- ie OS, PHP/DB/Python/etc

			(if in doubt, always include this info!)

		b.	A clear and concise description of what the problem is, what
			you did to see the problem and any additional info that you
			think might be relevant to helping us help you fix the
			problem.


			IMPORTANT:
			==========

			Most useful of all are the torrentflux-b4rt logfiles for
			troubleshooting.  Always check these logfiles first and
			ALWAYS post the relevant info from them when posting on the
			forum!:

			- transfer logfiles - click on the logfile icon in the
			  transfer list to view the transfer logfiles

			- fluxd logfiles - the fluxd logs are located in the
			  Administration section for fluxd, one for fluxd general
			  messages and one for fluxd errors.  Check both of these
			  when troubleshooting fluxd problems.


		c.	What steps can be taken to reproduce the problem - this is
			useful to help others test your problem out.

		d.	A suggested fix for the problem if you think this is a bug -
			these kind of posts are always welcome!!!

			Please be very careful however before labelling something a
			'bug' before you are absolutely positive it is!


	3.	This is probably one of the most obvious important factors when
		asking a question on a technical forum but is surprisingly
		overlooked very often:

		MAKE SURE YOU ACTUALLY ASK A QUESTION!

		It's surprising how often people rock up on a forum with the
		intention of getting help, but they don't actually ask a
		question and only provide a load of information that leaves
		potential helpers thinking 'And.... the question is...?'!

		Also make sure you ask a question that doesn't just require a
		yes/no answer.  Before you actually submit the post, use the
		'Preview' feature to read over your message and check that any
		questions you ask won't be simple 'yes/no' answers (unless of
		course that's all you want!).


	Finally, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take the time to read the following
	document if you plan on asking a question on the forum. This is
	recommended reading for all levels of users who wish to get help on
	a technical forum:
