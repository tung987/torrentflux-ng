/**********************************************************************
Torrentflux-b4rt Fluazu Setup Guide
**********************************************************************/

Introduction

    Fluazu provides support for Azureus in Torrentflux-b4rt.  The
    azureus server runs in the background and the fluazu interface
    communicates with the azureus server to control the torrents running
    under Azureus.

    This guide covers:

    *   Requirements

    *   Installation and initial configuration of a working console
        based Azureus - no X required - plus installation of the Azureus
        XML over HTTP plugin.

    This HOWTO assumes you already have java installed.

    You should chown all the files you have created/downloaded to the
    user Azureus will run as.

    1.  Download necessary files:

        Go to:

        http://azureus.sourceforge.net/index_CVS.php

        Download:

        *   AzureusXXXX-XXX.jar
        *   log4j.jar
        *   commons-cli.jar

        Go to:

        http://azureus.sourceforge.net/plugin_details.php?plugin=xml_http_if

        Download the XML over HTTP plugin.

        Save all downloaded files in the same directory and rename
        AzureusXXXX-XXX.jar into Azureus2.jar

        Note:
        -----
        While it doesn't matter where you install Azureus, it is
        important that a directory called /var/www/.azureus exists and
        is writable by Azureus. It stores its configuration there (i
        think this is a bug?).

    2.  Run Azureus on the commandline and do some basic configuration
        (optional).  On the shell commandline run:

        java -jar Azureus2.jar --ui=console

        When Azureus shows up type this at the console to set ports:

        set TCP.Listen.Port 50000
        set UDP.Listen.Port 50001
        set UDP.NonData.Listen.Port 50002

        You may also want to check if the port configuration is ok with
        the following command in the azureus console:

        show nat

        Finally, exit out of Azureus for now:

        quit

    3.  Install XML over HTTP plugin:

        Make a directory called xml_http_if in your plugins directory,
        which should be where you installed Azureus.

        Unpack xml_http_if_1.0.zip into that directory.

    4.  Create a script that runs Azureus in background:

        Create an executable (+x) azureusd.pl file containing the
        following code:

        #!/usr/bin/perl

        use POSIX 'setsid';
        open STDIN, "/dev/null";
        open STDOUT,">/dev/null";
        open STDERR,">/dev/null";
        exit if fork > 0;
        setsid;
        exec("java -jar Azureus2.jar --ui=console");

    5.  Start up Azureus using the script created above.

        IMPORTANT:
        ----------
        Ensure the azureus server is run as the webserver user - use su
        or sudo if necessary.

Configuring Fluazu within Torrentflux-b4rt.

    1.  Login to torrentflux-b4rt web interface as an admin user:
        + admin
            + transfer
                + fluazu-settings

    2.  Enter the required Azureus server settings in the form and on
        the fluazu settings page and save.

        Example:
        -----
        Note this is only an example, enter the settings appropriate for
        your own Azureus server setup:

        Host: localhost
        Port: 6884
        Secure: false
        Username: none (leave empty)
        Password: none (leave empty)

    3.  Start fluazu-daemon - goto the following menu item:

        + admin
            + transfer
                + fluazu-settings

        and click the 'start' button.

        Fluazu will start up and connect to the Azureus server. After
        connecting to the Azureus server, the Fluazu settings page will
        show an additional form which makes it possible to see and set
        some additional settings for the Azureus server - eg global
        bandwidth and connection limits.

    Fluazu is now ready to use just like any other client within
    torrentflux-b4rt - just select 'azureus' as the transfer client when
    starting up new transfers.


Fluazu Limitations

    Due to the design of fluazu there are some limitations on what
    features are available when using Azureus in conjunction with
    Torrentflux-b4rt - all features that depend on process-list or
    netstat-per-transfer-code:

    -   The transfer hosts page within Torrentflux-b4rt will not display
        any connection information.

    -   The process list displayed in the superadmin window in
        Torrentflux-b4rt will not include any Azureus based transfers.

    -   The force stop feature within the superadmin pages will also not
        work with transfers running under Azureus.

    -   The maintenance feature in Torrentflux-b4rt (auto-restart of
        dead transfer client process) does not currently work.


Checking Azureus Works

    1.  Open a shell on the server and cd to the dir
        "bin/clients/fluazu" in your tfb-installation.

        For example if torrentflux-b4rt is installed in "/var/www" this
        would be "/var/www/bin/clients/fluazu"

    2.  Start a python shell. If python is in the path, just enter
        "python" and hit enter.  This should open up a interactive
        python shell:

       $:/var/www/bin/clients/fluazu# python
       Python 2.5 (r25:51908, Sep 19 2006, 23:00:51)
       [GCC 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)] on linux2
       Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
       >>>

    3.  At the python shell, start the dopal.interact module using the
        following commands:

        import dopal.interact
        dopal.interact.main()

        When prompted to enter the Azureus server settings in the python
        shell, do so:

        Enter host: localhost
        Enter port (default is 6884): 6884
        Enter user name (leave blank if not applicable): foobar

    Success!
    -------
    If the steps above succeeded, you will be connected to the
    server successfully and should see:

    ------------------------

    DOPAL 0.60 - interact module

    Connection object stored in 'connection' variable.
    Plugin interface stored in 'interface' variable.

    >>>

    You can now as further test print the connection using the
    command "print connection":

    >>> print connection
    DopalConnection for localhost [Azureus 2.5.0.4]

    For further information, check the examples-page for dopal:

    http://dopal.sourceforge.net/examples.html


    Failure!
    --------
    If the configuration failed, you will be unable to connect to the
    server correctly and should see something like:

    ------------------------

    DOPAL 0.60 - interact module

    Connection object stored in 'connection' variable.

    Error getting plugin interface object - could not connect to
    Azureus, error:
    URLError: <urlopen error (111, 'Connection refused')>
    ('http://localhost:6884/process.cgi')
    >>>

    The message is 'Connection refused' and in this test case the
    Azureus server at localhost was not running.
