torrentflux-b4rt 1.0 beta2
http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/tf-b4rt/trunk/?op=log&rev=3366


***** changes *****

- Transmission-Transfer-Client updates

- documentation updates (work in progress)

- defaultX theme updates

- icon updates

- sqlite: better catch connection errors (e.g. when db-creation fails because 
  of missing rights) (3304)

- ajax update now uses %-value for updating the bar (3239)

- index: modify run/seed tooltips to be different between advanced & quick
  modes (3234)

- torrent search: small tweak to display mininova results sorted by seed (3231)

- MaintenanceAndRepair: added fluazu-maintenance (analog fluxd, delete leftovers
  if found but no daemon running) (3214)

- index: make "processing request"-div work on IE (3171)

- admin/server:
  * split code/html in file validation (3212, 3208)
  * extend validation-check for transmissioncli, to check if file is really
    tfb-specific version (3210, 3206)
  * for incoming path, allow subdirs (3169)

- formatBytestokBMBGBTB now also returns filessize in Bytes if
  size < 1024 (3154)

- admin/stats: move 'Use Compression' option directly before
  'Compression Level' (3145)

  * handle https (requires php with openssl module) (3123)



***** fixes *****

- various theme-related bugfixes

- netstat:
  * Fixes a bug in detecting ports in use on BSD, which caused 
    transmission to attempt to bind to the same port every time you 
    started a new torrent. (3321)
  * Fixed bug in netstatConnectionsSum for FreeBSD, altered system calls
    to be more resource-efficient by having sockstat output the right
    stuff and leave less for grep/awk to parse. (3322)
  * Fixed a bug in the netstat code where fbsd machines might see the 
    port of a running transmission transfer as 80, since transmission
    opens both port 80 and a high-numbered port from the minport-maxport
    range. (3323)
  * Fixed a bug that would cause transmission not to select the next 
    availible port if, and only if, there was no outgoing connection 
    from the client on the previous port number, and you are using BSD. 
    Now, we will always select a valid port number. (3326)

- sqlite: fix some SQL queries with joins (use field aliases to get same 
  behavior as other dbs) Thanks to Korax1 on IRC (3307)

- fluxd rssad filter edit-page: fix superfluous HTML-encoding of 
  filter entries (3305)

- bandwidth-bar: fixed style-issue if up or download is above 100% (3295)

  * add --keepbrokenbin when "Bad File Action" is "Download Anyway" (3298)
  * fix 150 kB/s speed limit (3288)
  * fix missing newline in output (3287)

- xfer-display:
  * fix B/MB mismatch when calculating % (3286)
  * fix bar width in themes other than defaultX (3286)

- fluxcli.php: fix xfer command (amounts in MB were handled as B) (3260)

- wget-Transfer-Client: ps --pid switch does not exist on FreeBSD, use -p
  instead (3237)

- fluxd:
  * fix "cannot determine peer address" on FreeBSD (3290, 3291, 3292, 3296)
  * small fix in sub "set" (3233)

- SimpleHTTP: accept URLs containing '+' (pass them thru, don't re-encode
  them) (3232)

- transfer-control: avoid pid file access if not needed (3222)

- setup.php: small fix to detect sqlite correctly (3221)

- admin/server: fix php-cli checks freezing if php binary path is a cgi/fcgi

  * TorrentSpy: switch to a download URL that works for now (3282)
  * fix parsing of mininova results so the number of comments isn't displayed
    as part of the torrent name (3231)
  * broken if Transfer File Download was disabled (3166)

- unified use of HTTP no-cache headers (pragma & cache-control) (3164)

- added a line to allow for .prio files -- people were getting massive amounts
  of "Invalid Transfer" errors without this line (3162)

- index: new injected torrents now have &nbsp; again in columns t.up,
  t.down (3160)

  string (3158)

- index: new torrents were showing "B" for total up/down (3157)

  is selected in form (3113)

  are missing (3110)

  * ajax silent-mode was not working properly because of missing {}.
  * added some checks so it is not possible to start an second update while
    first still not finished.
  * added an unload method, because it was possible to press F5 and before
    reloading was started, an ajax request could be started because timer was
	still running, which then produced errors in FF.
  * if ajax_update() was called the second time, the ajax_HTTPRequest existed
    already and so it aborted old request, which results in readystat = 0,
	which calls the Callback.
  * changed ajax_pageUpdate so it only updates the "span_update" if needed.

  details: https://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/forum/index.php/topic,587.0.html

  (fluxd_Maintenance_trestart) was ignored, like it was always true (2867)

- clienthandler-stop: give transfer 1 more second time after waitForTransfer
