    This is the manual for the transfer control client torrentflux-b4rt.

    The manual is split into the following sections:

        o User operations
            - covers day to day basic use of torrentflux-b4rt

        o Administration operations
            - covers configuration of torrentflux-b4rt and other
              operations that require administration rights in
              torrentflux-b4rt

        o Advanced operations
            - covers advanced concepts such as fluxd operation (fetching
              rss torrents automatically, watching folders and uploading
              new torrents automatically) and running the fluxcli.php
              script from the commandline or cron jobs.

    For an overview of the capabilities of torrentflux-b4rt and
    requirements, installation guide, features and author list, please
    see the README, INSTALL and FEATURES files located in the
    distribution root folder.




    User operations

        Working with metadata files (.torrent, .wget, .nzb files)

        This section uses the term 'metadata files' to refer
        collectively to .torrent, .wget and .nzb files.

            Uploading metadata (.torrent, .wget, .nzb) files

                Uploading individual metadata files from your filesystem

                    To upload a metadata file from your filesystem:

                        1. Click on the 'Browse...' button next to the
                           text field labelled 'Select a Metafile for
                           upload (.torrent, .wget, .nzb):'.

                        2. Browse to the location containing the meta
                           file you want to upload, select the file and
                           click 'OK'.
                        3. Click the 'Go' button next to the 'upload
                           metafile' text field.

                        4. (Optional) To upload and start the transfer
                           at the same time, select 'Upload+Start' from
                           the drop-down list next to the filename text
                           field.

                Uploading multiple torrent files from your filesystem

                    To upload more than one torrent file at a time,
                    there are two options:

                    Javascript multi upload method:

                    1.  Enter the filename of the first torrent in the
                        filename field.

                    2.  Click the 'More...' link underneath the filename
                        text field.

                        A new filename text field will appear for you to
                        enter a new file to upload.  You can repeat the
                        above until you have the filenames of all files
                        you wish to upload.  When you're done, click
                        'Go' to upload all the files at once.

                    Multiple Upload page method:

                    1. Click on the 'Multiple Upload' link underneath
                       the 'Select filename for upload' text field.

                       You will be directed to a new page with a number
                       of empty filename text fields where you can enter
                       the names of the files you wish to upload.  When
                       all files are selected, click 'Go' to upload.

                    In both methods above, you can have the files upload
                    and start immediately by selecting the correct
                    option from the drop down list - 'Upload+Start'.

                Uploading metadata files from a URL

                    Metadata files (.torrent, .nzb and .wget files) can
                    be uploaded directly from a remote URL (http/ftp) to
                    torrentflux-b4rt.  This saves having to download the
                    file first and then upload it separately.

                    To upload a metadata file from a remote URL (ie
                    http://example.com/torrentfile.torrent):

                    1.  Enter the URL in the text field labelled 'URL
                        for the Torrent File:'.

                    2.  Click the 'Go' button next to the text field.

                    3.  (Optional) To upload and then start the
                        transfer, select 'Get File+Start' from the
                        dropdown list next to the URL field.

                    The same operation can be completed for .wget files
                    and .nzb files if enabled by the administrator.


            Downloading metadata files

                Metadata files that have already been uploaded to
                torrentflux-b4rt can be downloaded by clicking on the
                green down arrow to the left of the transfer list item.

                You will be prompted to save the metadata file to disk
                or open it with a suitable application if your browser
                is configured to handle the metadata file type.

                Example:
                --------
                This feature is useful for when you want to confirm the
                integrity of a torrent file that doesn't appear to be
                transferring correctly.  Just download the file by
                clicking the download button and then open the torrent
                file in a standalone torrent client.

                This way you can see whether the torrent is working as
                it should in a different torrent client and verify
                whether there is a problem with the client you're using
                in torrentflux-b4rt.

            Searching for torrent files

                Performing a search

                    To search for a torrent file:

                    1.  Enter the keywords you wish to search for in the
                        text field labelled 'Torrent Search:'.

                    2.  Select the torrent search engine you wish to use
                        from the dropdown list next to the text box.

                    3.  Click the 'Search' button.

                    A search will then be made for the keywords you
                    entered on the search engine you specified and the
                    results will be listed.

                    Click on the name of the torrent in the results list
                    to download the torrent file directly to
                    torrentflux-b4rt.

                Working in the search results page

                    The search results page lists all the torrents that
                    matched the keywords you searched for, including the
                    following information:

                        o Torrent name
                            - password protected downloads are marked
                              with a bold 'P'
                            - torrents which require you to register
                              first before downloading them are marked
                              with a bold 'R'
                        o Category
                        o Size
                        o Seeds
                        o Peers

                    Clicking on the torrent name will download the
                    torrent to torrentflux-b4rt.

                    Clicking on a category name will fetch a list of all
                    torrents in that category from where torrents can be
                    downloaded by clicking on them.

                    Seedless transfers can be hidden from the search
                    result list by clicking on the 'Hide Seedless' link.

            RSS feed torrents

                The RSS torrents page can be browsed by clicking on the
                link 'RSS Torrents' in the middle of the window above
                the transfer list/drivespace bar.

                An RSS feed item can be downloaded by clicking on it's
                name in the RSS feed list page.

                If you don't see any feed items on the RSS torrents
                page, contact your administrator to get the RSS feeds
                added.

                Note, the RSS torrents page does not download torrents
                automatically using RSS!  For this functionality you
                must use the Fluxd daemon's Rssad module.  See
                TODO:rssad_link for information on configuring this.

                IMPORTANT:
                ----------
                If you are unable to download the RSS feed item when you
                click on it, make sure that the item you're trying to
                download is actually a torrent file and not just a link
                to the page that contains the file.

                The RSS feed your administrator adds MUST be a 'direct
                download' feed.  This is a feed of torrent URLs which
                can be downloaded directly (instead of having to visit a
                'details' page first and then download the torrent from
                that page).


        Controlling transfers
            Controlling individual transfers
                Starting individual transfers in advanced mode

                    Click the icon with a single white arrow on a green
                    background - located next to the transfer list item
                    on the far left of the listing - to open the
                    advanced start window.

                    The transfer settings window will open on the
                    'Control' page.  On this page you can modify a
                    number of settings before starting the transfer.

                    Once any modifications to the settings are made,
                    click 'Run Transfer' to start the transfer running.

                    To close the settings window after starting the
                    torrent, check the checkbox named 'Close Window'.

                    To NOT run a hash check before starting a torrent,
                    check the checkbox named 'Don't check hashes'.  This
                    is useful for when you have a very large torrent
                    that you know has been downloaded fully already and
                    you don't want to spend a long time having the
                    torrent client rechecking the integrity of the
                    download before continuing on to seed the torrent.
                    Note: Skip Hash Check is not supported for "fresh"
                    transfers. (which have not written any data to the
                    disk yet)

                    For full information on changing a transfer's
                    settings see the section on
                    TODO_link:changing_transfer settings

                    Note:
                    -----
                    The start advanced icon is only visible if the
                    torrent has not already started or is not in the
                    process of stopping.  To verify this, look at the
                    status column in the transfer listing which will
                    tell you whether the transfer is starting, started,
                    connecting, seeding, leeching, stopping, stopped or
                    new.

                Starting individual transfers in quick mode

                    Click the icon with a double white arrow on a green
                    background - located next to the transfer list item
                    on the far left of the listing - to start a transfer
                    in 'quick' mode.

                    Starting a transfer in quick mode allows you to skip
                    the advanced settings window. When a Transfer is
                    resumed, the last used client and settings of this
                    transfer are used to start it and if it is new one
                    the default client and settings configured by the
                    administrator will be used to start the transfer.
                    (unless the settings are changed on the settings-
                    page of a transfer prior to starting it)

                    See the section on TODO_link:transfer_client_options

                Stopping individual transfers

                    Click the icon with a white square on a red
                    background - located next to the transfer list item
                    on the far left of the listing - to stop a running
                    transfer.

            Controlling multiple transfers using the multi-ops feature

                Overview

                    The multi-ops feature of torrentflux-b4rt allows you
                    to perform the same operation on more than one
                    transfer at a time.

                Using multi-ops

                    1.  Select the transfers from the transfer list that
                        you want to perform the multi-op on by checking
                        their checkboxes to the far right of the
                        transfer list.

                        Note - to toggle the selection of ALL transfers,
                        check the checkbox at the bottom of the transfer
                        list to the far right next to the multi-ops
                        dropdown list.  Unchecking this checkbox will
                        deselect all transfers.

                        This can be useful if you have a large list of
                        transfers and you want to perform a multi-op on
                        only 90% of the transfers.

                    2.  Select the type of multi-op you want to perform
                        on the selected transfers from the drop down
                        list located under the transfer list to the far
                        right.

                    3.  Click the 'Go' button to perform the chosen
                        multi-op on the selected transfers.

                        WARNING:
                        --------
                        You will NOT be prompted for confirmation to
                        perform the multi-op so be sure that you really
                        want to carry out the action before using the
                        multi-op feature!

                Available multi-op operations

                    The operations that can be performed using multi-ops
                    are listed below:

                    o   starting and stopping more than one transfer

                    o   deleting transfer metafiles
                        - ONLY the metafiles are deleted, any transfer
                          data downloaded will NOT be deleted with this
                          option.

                          Choose this option if you have yet to move the
                          transfer data out of the torrentflux-b4rt data
                          directory.

                    o   deleting transfer metafiles and data
                        - delete both the transfer metafile - ie
                          .torrent file etc - AND the transfer data.

                          Be careful when using this option, only use it
                          when you have no more use for the data that
                          has been downloaded.

                    o   resetting transfer totals
                        - reset any information stored about how much
                          data has been transferred for this transfer -
                          cumulative upload/download totals.

                          Only use this option if you don't need to know
                          about how much data has been transferred in
                          total for a transfer.

                    o   wiping transfers
                        - deletes any transferred data and resets the
                          totals for the transfer.

                          Be careful when using this option, only use it
                          when you want any transferred data removed.

            Controlling multiple transfers using the bulk-ops feature

                Overview

                    A number of actions can be performed on all the
                    transfer is the transfer list at the same time.
                    This is quicker than performing the action on each
                    transfer individually or even by using the multi-ops
                    feature.

                    The operations that can be performed in bulk are:

                    o   Start all transfers
                    o   Resume all transfers
                    o   Stop all transfers

                    'Start all transfers' will start every single
                    transfer in the transfer list <b>regardless of
                    whether they have previously been started or
                    not</b>.

                    'Resume all transfers' will only start those
                    transfers in the transfer list that have already
                    previously been started and are currently in the
                    'stopped' state.

                    'Stop all transfers' stops all currently running
                    transfers in the transfer list.

                    The bulk-ops start/resume are safe to use on a
                    transfer list where some transfers are already
                    running - only those transfers that aren't currently
                    running will be started or resumed.  A transfer
                    won't accidentally be started twice!

                    Controlling bulk transfer operations

                Using bulk-ops

                    To use the bulk-ops feature, click on the
                    'Start/Stop/Resume All Transfers' icon at the bottom
                    of the transfer list next to the multi-ops dropdown
                    list.  The icons are a white arrow on a green
                    background, a double white arrow on a green
                    background and a white square on a red background
                    respectively for start, resume and stop.

            Transfer settings window

                Overview

                    The transfer settings window allows fine grained
                    control over your transfers and access to detailed
                    statistics and logs.

                    The options available in the settings window will
                    differ according to the type of transfer and the
                    status of the transfer - if the transfer is
                    currently running or not.

                    The transfer settings window is primarily used to
                    modify the settings of a currently running transfer
                    'on the fly' and to view statistics and logging info
                    for the transfer.

                    The transfer settings window is also used to modify
                    the settings of a client / transfer when starting a
                    transfer in 'advanced mode'.  See
                    TODO_link:'Starting individual transfers in advanced
                    mode'

                Opening the transfer settings window

                    The transfer settings window can be opened by using
                    any of the following methods:

                            or stopped - to use this method.

                        o   Clicking on the 'Transfer Settings' icon to
                            the far right of the transfer item in the
                            transfer list.

                    A number of different 'views' or pages are available
                    in the transfer settings window, these are covered
                    below.

                Viewing general transfer statistics

                    The 'Stats' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view the following information about
                    your transfer:

                        o   Estimated Time - time until transfer

                        o   Seed Until - the share ratio at which
                            seeding should stop.  Otherwise known as
                            'sharekill' ratio - ie 'stop sharing when
                            this ratio is reached'

                Viewing a transfer's hosts

                    The 'Hosts' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view a list of the hosts currently
                    connected with respect to this transfer.

                    A host in this list may not necessarily be actively
                    transferring data to/from us.  A host can be
                    connected and just in the process of negotiating the
                    transfer of data.

                Viewing a transfer's scrape information

                    The 'Scrape' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view the number of seeds vs leechers
                    for the current transfer in the form of a pie chart.

                Viewing 'at a glance' pie charts of a transfers statistics

                    The 'Images' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view at a glance the total uploaded vs
                    downloaded and the number of peers vs seeders.

                Viewing a transfer's log file

                    The 'Log' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view the detailed logging information
                    for the current transfer.

                    The transfer log is the first place to look when
                    troubleshooting a problematic transfer.  In it you
                    will find all the information output from the
                    transfer client and errors relating to a problem are
                    often displayed there.

                Viewing a transfer's metadata details

                    The 'Details' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view detailed meta information about
                    the current transfer - the transfer filename,
                    hashing info, details of what files/directories are
                    included in the transfer, transfer size and the
                    announce url for torrents.

                Viewing the files included in a transfer

                    The 'Files' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to see what files are included in a
                    transfer once complete.

                Changing settings for a transfer

                    The 'Settings' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to modify the settings related to the
                    current transfer.

                    If a transfer has already started, any changes made
                    to the settings can be sent to the transfer's
                    client 'on the fly' by checking the checkbox
                    labelled 'Send Changes to Client' (set by default if
                    a transfer is already running).  There is no need to
                    stop the transfer before making changes to a
                    transfer's settings.

                    The settings available for a transfer will differ
                    depending on the client chosen to perform the
                    transfer.  Not all settings are available for all
                    choices of clients.

                Starting, stopping and restarting a transfer

                    The 'Control' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to start, stop or restart a transfer.
                    The available options available will differ
                    depending on the current status of the transfer.

                    When the transfer is currently stopped, the control
                    page resembles the 'Settings' page in that all the
                    settings are available for modification prior to
                    starting the transfer.

                    When the transfer is currently running, the control
                    page is limited to the stopping or restarting of a
                    transfer.

            Transfer status lights

                The transfer status light for a transfer is displayed to
                the far left of the transfer list.  The colour of the
                transfer status light determines the current status of
                the transfer.

                The colours of the transfer status light are as follows:

                o   Black
                    - transfer is not running.

                o   Red
                    - transfer is running but no seeds are currently
                      available for the transfer.  If this status
                      persists you should check:

                        * the transfer log for any errors (see
                          TODO_link:Viewing transfer log files)

                        * the torrent's tracker is online

                        * your firewall is configured to allow
                          connections to/from the client

                        * the torrent actually has any seeds available
                          at all

                      It is also worth testing that the torrent works
                      correctly in another torrent client if the red
                      light status continues, although be sure that the
                      client you test in does not use Distributed Hash
                      Tables (DHT or 'trackerless') because this maybe
                      affect the results of the comparison test.

                o   Yellow
                    - transfer is running but there are less than two
                      seeds available.  This can indicate that a torrent
                      is not well seeded and if this status continues
                      you may need to find a better seeded torrent or
                      use a DHT/trackerless enabled client.

                o   Green
                    - transfer is running with at least two seeds.

            General frontend  'Good looking' statistics

                The 'Good looking' statistics are displayed to the top
                right of the torrentflux-b4rt frontend and include the
                following statistics:

                o   Download Speed- total download speed for all
                    running transfers

                o   Upload Speed - total upload speed for all running
                    transfers

                o   Total Speed - total upload + download speed for all
                    running transfers

                o   Connections - total network connections for all
                    running transfers

                o   Drive Space - total hard disk drive space currently
                    in use for the filesystem where torrentflux-b4rt
                    downloads transfers to

                o   Server Load - current server load averages of the
                    server.  A sustained load average of over 2 in each
                    of the three readings can be indicative of excessive
                    server load depending on the server role.

                Clicking on any of the links in the 'Good looking'
                statistics section will open up the 'Server statistics'
                page.

            Viewing detailed server statistics

                Overview
                    The server statistics page provides detailed
                    information on server status, including drivespace,
                    logged-in users, process, network and transfer usage.

                    The server statistics page can be opened using the
                    following methods:

                    -   Clicking on any of the links in the 'Good
                        looking statistics' section of the frontend.

                    -   Clicking on the 'Server Stats' link above the
                        drivespace bar towards the middle of the
                        frontend.

                Drivespace and 'who' statistics

                    This is the default view for the server statistics
                    page labelled 'all' in the drop down list labelled
                    'Type' at the top of the server stats page.

                    This view provides information about:

                    o   Current drivespace used on the filesystem where
                        torrentflux-b4rt downloads transfers to.  The
                        output is taken from the Unix command 'df'.

                    o   Currently logged in users on the server - ie
                        'real' shell users on the server that
                        torrentflux-b4rt is installed on.  The output is
                        taken from the Unix command 'w' or 'who'.


                Process statistics

                    This view can be set by selecting 'ps' from the
                    'Type' dropdown list on the server stats page.

                    The view displays information about any currently
                    running processes for each of the transfer clients
                    supported by torrentflux-b4rt.

                Network connection statistics

                    This view can be set by selecting 'netstat' from the
                    'Type' dropdown list on the server stats page.

                    The view displays information about any network
                    connections currently connected for any of the
                    supported torrentflux-b4rt transfer clients.

                Transfer statistics

                    This view can be set by selecting 'xfer' from the
                    'Type' dropdown list on the server stats page.

                    The view displays transfer statistics - ie amount of
                    bandwidth used - in a table.  Statistics are given
                    for bandwidth used for each user in total, over the
                    last month, over the last week and for the current
                    day.

                    A detailed breakdown of 'per user' or 'total'
                    transfer statistics can be viewed by clicking on the
                    links in the initial transfer stats page.  On this
                    detailed page you can view statistics for any single
                    day within the last 30 days.

            Opening the server monitor

                The server monitor can be opened by clicking on the
                'green light on a white background' image above the
                drivespace bar towards the middle of the frontend.

                The following information is displayed in the server
                monitor:

                    o   Download Speed
                    o   Upload Speed
                    o   Total Speed
                    o   Connections
                    o   Drive Space
                    o   Server Load
                    o   Transfers running
                    o   Transfers queued

                The server monitor is updated every 5 seconds by default
                - update interval can be changed in the (TODO_link:
                Setting the server monitor update interval) webapps
                admin section.

            Viewing an RSS feed of the transfer list

                An RSS feed of the transfer list can be displayed by
                clicking on the RSS icon (icon with orange background
                and white arcs).

                The RSS feed can be subscribed to in your feed reader,
                allowing another method for monitoring the status of
                your transfers.

            Viewing activity history

                The activity history can be viewed by regular users by
                clicking on the 'History' link in the top right
                navigation menu.

                The activity history page displays information about all
                activities performed by the user in the last 30 days.

                The history page is a good place to look when
                troubleshooting problematic transfers.

        Changing the frontend look and feel

            Reordering the transfer list

                The transfer items in the transfer list are reordered by
                clicking on the various transfer list column headers at
                the top of the transfer list.

                For example, to change the display of transfer list
                items so the oldest items are displayed towards the top
                of the list, click on the first transfer list column header
                (above the transfer status lights) marked with a '#'.

                The transfer list reordering options are as follows -
                clicking the mentioned column header will toggle the
                sorting:

                o   Order by date transfer added to torrentflux-b4rt
                    - click column header labelled '#'

                o   Order by transfer file name alphabetically
                    - click column header labelled 'Transfer File'

                o   Order by transfer owner
                    - click column header labelled 'User'

                o   Order by transfer size
                    - click column header labelled 'Size'

                o   Order by total downloaded
                    - click column header labelled 'T. Down'

                o   Order by total uploaded
                    - click column header labelled 'T. Up'

                o   Order by transfer status
                    - click column header labelled 'Status'

                o   Order by percentage completed
                    - click column header labelled 'Progress'

                o   Order by download bandwidth
                    - click column header labelled 'Down'

                o   Order by upload bandwidth
                    - click column header labelled 'Up'

                o   Order by number of seeders
                    - click column header labelled 'Seeders'

                o   Order by number of peers
                    - click column header labelled 'Peers'

                o   Order by estimated time left til completion
                    - click column header labelled 'Estimated Time'

                o   Order by type of transfer client
                    - click column header labelled 'C' - client types
                      are denoted as follows:

                        B: tornado
                        T: transmission
                        M: mainline
                        A: azureus
                        W: wget
                        N: nzbperl

                Note:
                -----
                The 'Enable sortable' feature must be enabled in
                the 'index' settings page in the admin section to allow
                reordering of transfers.

                The columns available in your transfer list may differ
                depending on how the administrator has configured the
                display of transfer lists.  See the section on TODO_LINK
                'Setting the default transfer list columns to display'.

                The transfer list columns can also be configured on a
                per user basis by modifying the user profile settings if
                the administrator has allowed profile management.
                See the section on TODO_LINK 'Changing what to display
                in the frontend'.
                Also see the administration section on TODO_LINK
                'Allowing users to use transfer profiles' for info on
                enabling or disabling individual user profile
                management.

            Turning AJAX updates on and off

                The transfer list can be updated automatically using
                AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML).  To turn on AJAX
                updates, click on the link 'Turn ON AJAX-Update' under
                the transfer list.

                The update text will change to:

                    'Next AJAX-Update in xx seconds'

                where xx is the countdown in seconds until the next
                AJAX update (default 5 seconds).  The timer will count down
                until it reaches zero, at which point the transfer list
                will be refreshed.

                To turn off AJAX updates, click on the link 'Next
                AJAX-Update in xx seconds' again.

                The AJAX update interval can be configured either globally
                by the administrator ('index' section of the admin
                pages) or individually on a per-user basis in the user's
                profile.

            Turning page refresh on and off

                The main torrentflux-b4rt index page containing the
                transfer list can be updated automatically using the
                HTML meta refresh method.  To turn on page refresh,
                click on the link 'Turn ON Page Refresh' under the
                transfer list.

                The refresh text will change to:

                    'Next Page Refresh in xx Seconds'

                where xx is the countdown in seconds until the next
                refresh (default 60 seconds).  The timer will count down
                until it reaches zero, at which point the page will be
                refreshed.

                To turn off automatic page refreshes, click on the link
                'Next Page Refresh in .. Seconds' again.

                The refresh interval can be configured either globally
                by the administrator ('index' section of the admin
                pages) or individually on a per-user basis in the user's
                profile.

                Note:
                -----
                Using the page refresh method, the whole page is
                reloaded - not just the transfer list.  This option is
                now largely deprecated in favour of the AJAX update
                method, which only updates the transfer list instead of
                the whole page and so uses up less bandwidth.

            Showing/hiding seeding torrents

                Clicking on the 'Hide Seeding Torrents' link under the
                transfer list will hide all currently seeding torrents.

                This is useful when you have a lot of transfers in the
                transfer list that are in the 'Seeding' state that you
                don't want to keep an eye on continually.

                This feature can be configured either globally in the
                'index' section of the admin pages or on a per user
                basis in the user's profile.

        Profile management

            Overview

                The user profile page is available by clicking on the
                'Profile' link in the navigation menu at the top right
                of the frontend.

                A number of options and settings can be changed on a per
                user basis, including general user settings (password,
                default theme, language), what is displayed in the
                frontend, what cookies to use for cookie enabled sites
                and the option to create different transfer profiles for
                different transfer situations.

            General

                Changing password/theme/language

                    The following items can be changed directly on the
                    'Profile' page:

                    o   User name
                    o   Password
                    o   Default Theme
                    o   Language
                    o   Whether to hide offline users on the frontend

                Changing what to display in the frontend

                    A large number of frontend display settings can be
                    changed on a per user basis.  These options are
                    available under the 'Personal Settings' heading on
                    the 'Profile' page.

                    The frontend display options which can be configured
                    are as follows:

                    TODO: put links to admin help for each of the
                    following

                    o   Page Refresh

            External cookie management

                Overview

                    Torrentflux-b4rt can be configured to use HTTP
                    cookies when performing any operation that involves
                    a HTTP request with a website that requires cookies.

                    This is mainly used for downloading torrent files
                    from a private tracker that requires you to use
                    cookies for authentication.

                    The following sections describe how to use external
                    cookies with torrentflux-b4rt.

                How to obtain cookie information

                    FireFox

                        *   Tools => Options

                        *   Cookies => View Cookies

                        *   Locate the site you want to get cookie
                            information from.

                        *   Copy the cookie values for the variables
                            that the site uses.

                            Common cookie variables used in torrent sites
                            are UID and PASS, although these will differ
                            from site to site.  See your torrent site FAQ
                            or Forum for more info.

                    Internet Explorer

                        *   Tools => Internet Options
                        *   General => Settings => View Files
                        *   Locate cookie file for site (eg: Cookie:user@www.host.com/)
                        *   Open the file in a text editor
                        *   Grab the values below UID and PASS

                            The file will look something like this:

                             --------

                Adding cookies

                    Enter the domain of the website you want to use
                    cookies for in the text field labelled 'Host:'.

                    Enter the cookie string you want to use in the text
                    field labelled 'Data:'.

                    Example:
                    --------

                    If the cookie variables you want to send are:

                    o   uid with a value set to '99'
                    o   pass with a value set to 'foobar'

                    then the cookie string would look like:

                    o   uid=99;pass=foobar;

                    Once the Host/Data fields are completed, click 'Add'
                    to add the cookie.

                    The cookie will now be used whenever you perform an
                    action that involves an HTTP request with the
                    domain.

                Editing cookies

                    Click on the 'Edit' icon next to the cookie you want
                    to edit.  On the resulting page, modify the cookie
                    as needed and click 'Update' when finished.

                Deleting cookies

                    Click on the 'Delete <domain>' icon next to the
                    cookie you want to delete.  This will remove the
                    cookie from the current user's profile.


            Transfer profile management

                Overview

                    The transfer profile management section is found on
                    the user's 'Profile' page.  Click the link 'Transfer
                    Profiles Management' to open the transfer profiles
                    management window.

                    A transfer profile is a pre-defined set of transfer
                    options which are saved under a transfer profile
                    name.  The transfer profile(s) can then be used at
                    a later date when you start a new transfer, saving
                    you the effort of having to manually go through each
                    of the settings for that transfer tweaking them to
                    suit the type of transfer you're performing.

                    Example:
                    --------
                    You use a private torrent tracker that requires you
                    keep at least a ratio of 1.05.  Rather than manually
                    go through the settings each time you start a
                    torrent for that private tracker, instead you can
                    create a transfer profile with the following
                    settings:

                    o   'Percentage When Seeding should Stop:' = '105'
                    o   'Max upload rate' = 0 - no restriction on upload
                        speed

                    Now each time you start a new transfer that uses the
                    private tracker, just select the profile from the
                    transfer settings window - the sharekill ratio
                    will automatically be set to 105 and there will be
                    no restriction on how fast you upload to leeching
                    peers meaning you should meet your ratio of 1.05
                    faster.

                Adding transfer profiles

                    To add a transfer profile, complete the form on the
                    transfer profiles management page and click the
                    'Add' button.

                    If you wish the profile to be available to all other
                    users, check the 'Public Profile' checkbox.

                Editing transfer profiles

                    To edit a transfer profile, click the 'Edit
                    <profilename>' icon next to the profile.  This will
                    load the profile's settings and allow you to modify
                    them.

                    When you are happy with the changes, click the
                    'Update' button to save the profile.

                Deleting transfer profiles

                    To delete a transfer profile, click on the red
                    button with a cross on it next to the profile.

        Directory / file manager

            Overview

                The directory manager allows you to work with the files
                and directories within the torrentflux-b4rt download
                directory.  Regular users are limited to working with
                the files in their own download folder - administrators
                can access any files in any directory within the master
                download folder.

                A number of different operations can be performed on
                files within the directory manager, including:

                o   Deleting files and directories
                o   Renaming files and directories
                o   Moving files and directories out of the transfer
                    directory
                o   Making torrents
                o   Downloading files and directories
                o   Downloading files and directories as tar or
                    zip archives
                o   Streaming media files using VLC

                o   Extracting archive files (zip/rar files)
                o   Checking the integrity of files using .sfv files

                Permission to perform these operations can be controlled

            Opening the directory manager

                The directory manager can be opened with the following
                actions from the torrentflux-b4rt frontend:

                o   Clicking the 'Directory' link in the navigation menu
                    at the top right of the screen

                o   Clicking the 'Directory List' link in the middle of
                    the screen

                o   Clicking on the folder icon to the left of a
                    transfer in the transfer list

                Once the directory manager is opened, directories can be
                browsed by clicking on folders.  To go 'up' a directory,
                click on the link '[Back Parent Directory]'.

                The available actions that can be performed on a file
                are listed to the right of the directory manager.  These
                actions will differ depending on the type of file.

                All files within a directory can be selected at the same
                time by checking the checkbox at the bottom right of
                the directory manager.  Checking the checkbox again will
                deselect all files.

            Deleting files and directories

                Individual files can be deleted by clicking on the icon
                with a white cross on a red background next to the file.

                Multiple files can be deleted at the same time by first
                selecting all the files you wish to delete and then
                clicking on the cross icon at the bottom right of the
                directory manager next to the 'select all' checkbox.

                You will be prompted for confirmation to delete the
                file(s) after clicking the cross icon.

            Renaming files and directories

                Files and directories can be renamed by clicking on the
                'Rename File/Folder' icon to the right of the file.  A
                window will open asking you to specify the name you wish
                to rename the file/folder to.  Complete this form and
                click 'Ok' to rename the file/folder.

                Note:
                -----
                Using this option, files and folder can only be renamed
                within the bounds of the master download directory.  To
                move files and folders *out* of the download directory,
                the 'Move File/Folder' action must be used. TODO_LINK:
                Moving files and directories out of the transfer
                directory

            Moving files and directories out of the transfer directory

                Files and directories can be moved out of the master
                transfer directory by clicking on the 'Move File/Folder'
                icon.  A window will open asking you to specify the
                destination directory in a drop down list or text box.

                Note:
                -----
                The destination folders for move actions must be
                configured by the administrator.  Any destination folders
                configured by the admin will be listed in the 'Move'
                window dropdown box.

                For more info on setting a list of directories to move
                files/folders into, see: TODO_LINK: Setting a list of
                allowed folders to move transferred files into

            Making torrents

                A torrent file can be created for a file or directory by
                clicking on the 'Make Torrent' icon.  A window will be
                displayed prompting for the necessary details for the
                torrent:

                o   Client - the client you want to use to create the
                    torrent file.

                o   Torrent name - the filename you wish to give the
                    torrent file

                o   Announcement URL - the URL of the tracker which will
                    be hosting the torrent file.  Check your tracker's
                    website for info on what to use for this option.

                o   Announce List - a list of alternative trackers to
                    use for this torrent.  This option allows you to
                    provide redundancy in the event that one tracker is
                    unavailable.

                o   Piece size - the size of chunks you wish your
                    torrent to be distributed in.

                o   Comments - any comments about the content of the
                    torrent.

                o   Private Torrent - whether or not this torrent is
                    private.  If private, the DHT / trackerless option
                    will be disabled.

                o   DHT Support - whether to support Distributed Hash
                    Tables for so-called 'trackerless' support.  Using
                    this option will allow clients with DHT support to
                    seek out peers using DHT instead of depending only
                    on static tracker servers.

                Torrent file creation will commence when the 'Create'
                button is clicked.  If the 'Notify me of completion'
                checkbox is checked, the create torrent window will
                display details of the torrent created once complete.

                When the torrent file is created, it will be displayed in
                the torrentflux-b4rt frontend ready for starting as with
                any other torrent.

            Downloading files and directories

                Files can be downloaded in a web browser by clicking on
                the 'Download' icon to the right of the file in the
                directory manager.

                Complete directories can be downloaded as a tar archive
                by clicking on the 'Download as tar' icon to the right
                of the directory in the directory manager.  This action
                will first create a tar archive of the complete
                directory listing and then send this to the web browser
                for download.

                Note:
                -----
                Downloading directories as tar archives can take a
                considerable amount of time if the directory structure
                is very large.

            Streaming media files using VLC

                Audio and Movie files can be streamed in real time from
                the server by clicking on the 'Stream Multimedia (vlc)'
                icon to the right of the file.

                This action will open a window with a form for you to
                specify the details for the streaming action.

                TODO: description of streaming with vlc.

            Viewing NFO files

                NFO files refer to a standard information file that
                contains pertinent information for a distribution or
                download, so-called because the file ends in .nfo.
                These nfo files can be viewed by clicking on the 'View
                nfo file' icon to the right of the file listing in the
                directory manager.

                The following file extensions are considered to be 'nfo'
                files by torrentflux-b4rt: .nfo, .txt, .log

            Extracting archive files (zip/rar files)

                Torrentflux-b4rt supports the extraction of zip and
                rar archive files.  To extract an archive file, click on
                the 'Unzip/Unrar' icon to the right of the file listing.

                A window will open prompting you for a password for the
                archive - enter the password here if applicable.  If
                there is no password as far as you know, leave the
                password field empty.

                Click 'OK' to extract the archive.

                Note:
                -----
                The extraction process may take a long time to complete
                if the archive is very large.  You may close the
                'Uncompress file' window once it has started, the
                uncompression process should continue in the background
                on the webserver.

            Checking the integrity of files using .sfv files

                SFV or 'simple file verification' files are often used
                by file distributors to check on the integrity
                of transferred files.  The sfv signatures on a
                transferred archive can be tested by clicking on the
                'Check sfv' icon to the left of the directory containing
                the sfv file.

        Troubleshooting

            Flushing the template cache

                Occasionally problems may occur with the templating
                system which make pages display incorrectly.  A first
                attempt at fixing this kind of problem is to flush the
                template cache.

                If you are unable to click on the icon, try browsing to
                the following URL:

                http://example.com/superadmin.php?m=35

                replacing 'example.com' with the URL of your
                torrentflux-b4rt installation.

                Alternatively delete the files direct which are located
                inside your main-path-directory:

                /path/to/maindir/.templateCache

            Running a maintenance operation

                Occasionally problems occur whereby the integrity of the
                files that are used to keep track of transfers can
                become corrupted.  This problem can lead to a situation
                where torrentflux-b4rt reports that a transfer is
                running when it isn't - or similar problems to this.

                A first attempt at solving this kind of problem is to
                perform a maintenance run from the front end which will
                check the status of the transfer's control files and fix
                any problems if possible.

                To make a maintenance run, click on the 'Maintenance'
                icon located at the bottom of the transfer list near to
                the bulk operations links.  The icon is a red and white
                life ring symbol.

                For more thorough maintenance tasks see the section on
                superadmin maintenance tasks

                TODO_LINK: Performing maintenance tasks

    Administration operations

        Superadmin

            Overview

                The superadmin pages are accessible only by the
                superadmin account holder - the administration account
                that is created the first time that torrentflux-b4rt is
                created.

                The superadmin pages are accessed by clicking on the
                'Superadmin' link on the administration pages - a new
                window will open with the superadmin pages in it.

                The superadmin pages allow you detailed control over the
                following tasks and areas:

                o   Transfers - bulk start/stop/resume transfers

                o   Processes - view detailed process info; force stop
                    transfer processes

                o   Maintenance - clean up and maintenance

                o   Backup - create backups; download saved backups

                o   Log - view logs

                o   Misc - test for PHP and Perl requirements; view list
                    of installed files

                o   About - version checking, updates, news,
                    changelog; check installed file integrity

                Be careful when using the superadmin features as many of
                them apply to all torrentflux-b4rt users and not just
                individual users.

            Controlling bulk transfer operations

                The superadmin transfer bulk-ops page allows you to
                operate on multiple transfers at one time.  The actions
                are identical to the bulk-ops feature available in the
                frontend.

                The transfer bulk-ops available in the superadmin pages
                are:

                o   Stop All Transfers - this option will stop all
                    currently running transfers

                o   Start All Transfers - this option will start all
                    transfers that are currently not running

                o   Resume All Transfers - this option will start *only*
                    those transfers that have already been previously
                    started

                See also:

                TODO_LINK: User operations - Controlling multiple
                transfers using the bulk-ops feature

            Working with processes

                Viewing detailed process listings

                    To view a detailed list of currently running
                    processes, click on the 'All' link on the
                    'Processes' tab in the superadmin pages.

                    A detailed list of all currently running processes
                    associated with torrentflux-b4rt will be displayed.

                    The output is divided into sections, one for each
                    client associated with torrentflux-b4rt.

                Force stopping processes

                    Problematic transfers can be forced to stop by using
                    the 'Transfers' link on the 'Processes' tab in the
                    superadmin pages.

                    The 'Transfers' page displays a list of all
                    currently running transfers, listing the user the
                    transfer belongs to and the transfer file name.

                    The transfers in this list can be force stopped by
                    clicking on the red icon in the right hand column next
                    to the transfer.

                    This force stop method sends a SIGKILL signal to the
                    process associated with the transfer if it is
                    refusing to shutdown graceful in time.

            Performing maintenance tasks

                Basic transfer maintenance

                    The 'Main' page of the 'Maintenance' tab in the
                    superadmin pages allows you to run maintenance tasks
                    on your torrentflux-b4rt installation.

                    The available options are:

                    o   Standard Maintenance Run

                        This option is the same as available on the
                        index page of the frontend and is automatically
                        called on every login.

                        The standard maintenance run performs the
                        following actions:

                        - Checks for stale fluxd PID and socket files
                          and removes them if found.

                        - Check for any transfers that are marked as
                          running but actually aren't running and update
                          their status to show them as not running.

                        - Update the database so the information stored
                          there is in line with the transfer files in
                          the filesystem.

                    o   Extended Maintenance Run

                        This option is exactly the same as the standard
                        maintenance run, except that any transfers that
                        are marked as running but aren't actually
                        running are restarted.

                Killing processes

                    The 'Kill' link on the 'Maintenance' tab of the
                    superadmin pages allows you to kill all processes
                    for a given type - PHP, Python, Perl,
                    Transmission, Wget, VLC.

                    This option will send a KILL signal to all processes
                    matching the type you choose.

                    NOTE:
                    -----
                    Be VERY careful when using this option and only use
                    it as a last resort or if you really know what you
                    are doing.

                    The kill signal sent will kill ALL processes of the
                    type you specify - for example if you choose to kill
                    all PHP processes, every PHP process running on the
                    server as the webserver user will be killed, not
                    just those related to torrentflux-b4rt!

                    If you choose to use this option to kill processes,
                    it is advisable to check what processes are running
                    first by issuing the following command as root:

                    ps aux | grep php

                    for example in the case of 'php'.  This will give
                    you an idea of what PHP processes are currently
                    running and you can be sure then that you are only
                    going to kill the processes you need to.

                Cleaning transfer file leftovers and client resources

                    The 'Clean' linked page on the 'Maintenance' tab of
                    the superadmin pages allows you to clean leftover
                    transfer pid files, client cache files and
                    torrentflux-b4rt's template cache files.

                    The actions available are:

                    o   PID File Clean

                        Deletes stale PID files from transfers.
                        Any transfers that are currently not running
                        should not have a PID file associated with it.
                        These stale PID files are deleted using this
                        option.

                    o   BitTornado Clean

                        Deletes the BitTornado cache.
                        BitTornado uses a cache whilst transferring
                        data.
                        This option deletes the BitTornado cache.

                    o   Transmission Clean

                        Deletes the Transmission cache.
                        Transmission uses a cache whilst transferring
                        data.

                Repairing problematic installations

                    The 'Repair' linked page on the 'Maintenance' tab of
                    the superadmin pages allows you to perform a
                    thorough repair of the torrentflux-b4rt
                    installation.

                    This option is the same as the basic 'maintenance'
                    run - TODO_LINK: superadmin maint etc except that
                    this option resets the stat files of any transfers
                    and deletes all transfer pids as if they had just
                    been newly injected.  No transfers are restarted
                    using this repair option.

                    Generally this option should only be taken as a last
                    resort if transfer's refuse to start at all.

                Resetting transfer totals, transfer stats and personal
                settings

                    The 'Reset' linked page on the 'Maintenance' tab of
                    the superadmin pages allows you to reset the
                    transfer totals, transfer statistics and personal
                    settings.

                    The options available are:

                    o   Reset Transfer Totals

                        Resets the transfer totals - total
                        uploaded/downloaded - for each transfer in the
                        transfer list.
                        Do not use this option if you are trying to keep
                        track of your ratio on trackers using the
                        transfer totals in the frontend!

                    o   Reset Xfer Stats

                        Resets the transfer statistics.
                        All transfer statistics on record are reset
                        using this option - how much has been downloaded
                        per user over the last day/month/year etc.

                    o   Reset Personal Settings

                        Resets the personal settings of all users.
                        All user's personal settings are reset to the
                        default values.  Be careful using this option as
                        all user's profiles are affected.

                Locking access to the frontend

                    The 'Lock' linked page on the 'Maintenance' tab of
                    the superadmin pages allows you to lock all access
                    to the torrentflux-b4rt frontend for non-admin
                    users.

                    When attempting to browse the frontend, users will
                    only see a message informing them the frontend is
                    locked.

            Backups

                Creating a backup
                    The 'Create Backup' linked page on the 'Backup' tab
                    of the superadmin pages allows you to create a
                    backup of all files associated with
                    Torrentflux-b4rt.

                    There are two options for where to store the backed
                    up data - decide which is most appropriate for you:

                    o   Backup on Server - this option will store the
                        backup archive on the server inside a folder
                        named '.backup' under the main path configured
                        in the 'server' tab on the admin pages.

                        Archives stored on the server can later be
                        viewed in torrentflux-b4rt using the 'Backups
                        currently on server' tab on the 'Backup' page of
                        the superadmin section.

                    o   Backup on Client - this option will send the
                        backup archive to you in your web browser so you
                        can save the backup locally.

                    Once you have decided where to save the backup to,
                    you can then choose what kind of compression to use
                    with the archive.

                    There are three compression options to choose from:

                    o   gzip - this is the default compression setting.
                        The archives will be compressed using gzip,
                        creating smaller archives.  This option is
                        faster than bzip2 but slower than 'none'.

                    o   bzip2 - the archives will be compressed using
                        bzip2, creating the smallest possible archives.
                        This option is the slowest compression option.

                    o   none - uses no compression when archiving.  The
                        archives will be archived using tar only, the
                        resulting archive size will be the same as the
                        space taken up by the files being archived.
                        This is the fastest compression option.

                    Select the compression option you want from the
                    dropdown list and finally click on the 'Backup'
                    button for the location you chose to save to.

                    The data that is backed up is as follows:

                    o   Document root directory structure - all files
                        underneath the webserver document root folder
                        where you installed Torrentflux-b4rt.

                        These files consist of the torrentflux-b4rt web
                        application itself.

                    o   The Transfers folder directory structure - all files
                        in the .transfers folder located in the path
                        configured in the admin pages 'server' tab.

                        The .transfer folder contains all control files
                        for the transfers in torrentflux-b4rt - pid,
                        stat and log files.

                    o   The fluxd folder directory structure - all files
                        in the .fluxd folder located in the path
                        configured in the admin pages 'server' tab.

                        The .fluxd folder contains control files for the
                        fluxd daemon - pid, socket and log files.

                    o   The MRTG folder directory structure - all files
                        in the .mrtg folder located in the path
                        configured in the admin pages 'server' tab.

                        The .mrtg folder contains control files for the
                        MRTG traffic graphing addon component.

                    o   The Torrentflux-b4rt database - the database
                        used to store information used in the day to day
                        running of torrentflux-b4rt.

                    An archive is made for each of the options listed
                    above and the resulting archives are then archived
                    again into a single archive.  In the case of the
                    filesystem backups, a backup is only made if the
                    relevant directory actually exists - so for example
                    if no '.mrtg' folder exists, no mrtg backup will be
                    made.

                Viewing a backup of transfer data

                    Any backups that are created on the server can be
                    viewed by clicking on the 'Backups currently on
                    server' link on the 'Backup' tab of the superadmin
                    pages.

                    Any backups created by torrentflux-b4rt on the
                    server are listed on the page, including information
                    about what version the backup is from, the date the
                    backup was created, what compression was used and
                    the size of the archive.

                    An archive can be downloaded or deleted by clicking
                    on the respective icon to the right of the backup
                    item in the list.

            Viewing log files

                Overview

                    The 'Log' tab on the superadmin pages allows you to
                    view the log files for various components of
                    torrentflux-b4rt:

                    o   fluxd - STDOUT logfiles for the torrentflux-b4rt
                        fluxd daemon.

                        The fluxd logfile contains day to day logging
                        information which should be the first place to
                        look when attempting to troubleshoot fluxd
                        problems, together with the fluxd error log.

                    o   fluxd-error - STDERR logfiles for the
                        torrentflux-b4rt fluxd daemon.

                        The fluxd error logfile contains any errors
                        encountered in the day to day running of fluxd.
                        Essential viewing when troubleshooting fluxd.

                    o   fluazu - logfiles for the fluazu interface to
                        Azureus.

                    o   BitTorrent Mainline - centralised logfile for
                        the BitTorrent Mainline client.

                    o   Transfers - logfiles for transfers in the
                        current transfer list.

                        Clicking the 'transfers' logfile link will take
                        you to a page containing a list of links to the
                        logfiles of all current transfers in the
                        transfer list.

            Miscellaneous actions

                Viewing a list of installed files and their checksums

                    The 'Lists' linked page on the 'Misc' tab of the
                    superadmin pages allows you to view a list of all
                    the torrentflux-b4rt files installed and their
                    checksums.

                    The file list feature displays a list of each file
                    under the current document root for the installation
                    and the version of each file if found.

                    The checksum feature displays a list of each file
                    under the current document root for the installation
                    and the checksum for each of those files.  The
                    checksum for a file is unique and when the file
                    contents change in any way, the checksum will also
                    change.  Checksums can therefore be used to
                    determine if the contents of a file have been
                    changed at some point by comparing the current
                    checksum to the checksum of the original file.

                Listing and verifying checksums of installed files

                    The 'Checksum Validation' linked page on the 'Misc'
                    tab of the superadmin pages allows you to check the
                    integrity of the files installed in your
                    installation of torrentflux-b4rt against a list
                    stored on the torrentflux-b4rt website.  This allows
                    you to verify whether any of your files have changed
                    since you installed them, alerting you to any
                    differences.

                    The script will analyse the files you have installed
                    and provide a detailed report about all
                    unchanged/changed/missing/new files.

                Checking software requirements

                    The 'Check Requirements' linked page on the 'Misc'
                    tab of the superadmin pages allows you to run tests
                    to check if your server's software meets the
                    requirements for running Torrentflux-b4rt
                    successfully.

                    The tests are as follows:

                    o   Check PHP Web Requirements

                        Check your PHP web installation meets the
                        requirements for web based activities in
                        torrentflux-b4rt.

                        This test will check that the currently
                        installed PHP web component has all the correct
                        extensions built in to run torrentflux-b4rt
                        correctly.

                    o   Check PHP CLI Binary Requirements

                        Check your PHP commandline binary installation
                        meets the requirements for commandline based
                        activities in torrentflux-b4rt.

                    o   Check Perl Requirements

                        Check your Perl installation meets the
                        requirements for perl based activities in
                        torrentflux-b4rt.

                        This option will check all perl modules required
                        for the correct operation of torrentflux-b4rt
                        are installed.

            Checking for updates, news and version info for your
            torrentflux-b4rt installation

                Checking your version against the latest version available

                    The 'Version' linked page on the 'About' tab of
                    the superadmin pages will display the current
                    version of your torrentflux-b4rt installation along
                    with information about the current latest version
                    available from the torrentflux-b4rt downloads pages.

                    This option allows you to see easily whether a new
                    version of torrentflux-b4rt is available for
                    download.

                    Note:
                    -----
                    When using the SVN version of torrentflux-b4rt,
                    details of the latest version are not displayed
                    since it is presumed you are using the bleeding edge
                    version of the software.

                Viewing news about releases

                    The 'News' linked page on the 'About' tab of the
                    superadmin pages displays a list of links to the
                    news page for each release of torrentflux-b4rt.

                    The list of news pages is obtained from the
                    torrentflux-b4rt website and so is always up to
                    date.

                Viewing the changelog for your release

                    The 'Changelog' linked page on the 'About' tab of the
                    superadmin pages displays a list of links to the
                    changelogs for each release of torrentflux-b4rt.

            Server options (server)

                Torrentflux-b4rt path configuration

                    The following paths must be configured for
                    torrentflux-b4rt to operate correctly:

                    o   Transfer Parent Path
                        The main torrentflux-b4rt parent path (<path>).

                        This directory is used to store all files used
                        in the day to day operation of torrentflux-b4rt.

                        The folder must be writable by the webserver
                        user and ideally owned by the webserver user.

                        Files and folders stored/used by the parent path
                        include:

                        *   Storage for downloaded transfers:

                            Content downloaded by torrentflux-b4rt will
                            be downloaded into <path>/<username> if the
                            use of home directories is enabled.

                            If home directories are not enabled,
                            downloaded content will be saved instead
                            into the path specified by the 'Incoming'
                            path instead.  See TODO_LINK: Admin/Server
                            section on 'Home Directories'

                        *   Transfer control files

                            Files used internally by torrentflux-b4rt to
                            control the download of individual transfers
                            are stored in the <path>/.transfers folder.
                            These files include:

                            o   .stat files - a stat file is created
                                when a transfer is injected into
                                torrentflux-b4rt.

                                The stat file is updated when a transfer
                                is running with information such as how
                                much data has been transferred, what
                                percentage of the transfer has
                                completed, how many seeds/peers the
                                transfer has and other items of
                                information.

                                The stat file is then read by the
                                torrentflux-b4rt internals to display
                                the status of the transfer in the
                                frontend.

                            o   .pid files - a pid file (process id
                                file) is created when a transfer is
                                started.  The file contains the process
                                id number of the transfer's process.

                                The pid file is used as an indication of
                                whether or not a transfer is running and
                                to forcefully stop the transfer in the
                                event that it becomes uncontrollable for
                                some reason.

                            o   .log files - a log file is created for
                                each transfer when the transfer is
                                started.  The logfile contains
                                information specific to that transfer as
                                it runs over time.

                            o   .cmd files - a cmd file is created when
                                torrentflux-b4rt has to send a command
                                to a running transfer.  The transfer's
                                client polls the .transfer folder
                                regularly for new cmd files and if it
                                finds one, it will read the command from
                                the cmd file and act upon it.

                                The lifetime of a cmd file should be
                                very short since the file is deleted as
                                soon as the command is executed.

                        *   Client cache files

                            Cache files used by BitTorrent Mainline,
                            Transmission and BitTornado are stored in
                            the .bittorrent, .BitTornado and
                            .transmission folders under <path>.

                        *   Fluxd control files

                            Files used for the control of fluxd are
                            contained in the <path>/.fluxd directory.
                            Files include:

                            o   fluxd-error.log - any error output from
                                fluxd

                            o   fluxd.log - standard output from fluxd

                            o   fluxd.pid - process id of currently
                                running fluxd service

                            o   fluxd.sock - socket file used to
                                communicate with fluxd

                            Additional directories may be created under
                            the .fluxd directory for use by the fluxd
                            modules, particularly the Qmgr and Rssad
                            modules.

                        *   Fluazu control files

                            Files used for the control of the fluazu
                            component of torrentflux-b4rt.

                        *   Torrentflux-b4rt template cache files

                            If template caching is used to display the
                            frontend HTML, template cache files are
                            stored in the <path>/.templateCache folder.

                        *   RSS cache files

                            If RSS feeds are added via the RSS admin
                            page, a cache of the feeds is stored in
                            <path>/.rsscache.  This speeds up display of
                            RSS feed contents in the frontend and takes
                            the strain off the remote server where the
                            RSS feed is fetched from.

                    o   Document Root Path

                        The Document Root path of the installation.

                        The folder must be readable by the webserver user.

                        This is the directory where you installed
                        torrentflux-b4rt on the webserver and it should
                        be detected/reported automatically by
                        torrentflux-b4rt.

                Binary path configuration

                    Torrentflux-b4rt integrates with many third party
                    applications to make performing operations on
                    transferred files seamless from the frontend.

                    For this integration to work, the associated
                    applications must of course be installed correctly
                    first.  For the best results you should use the
                    distribution management system for your particular
                    operating system to install the applications - apt,
                    rpm, etc on linux, the ports systems on BSD.

                    Once the applications required are installed, the
                    paths to the binaries must be set correctly on the
                    server admin page for the integration of that
                    application to work correctly.

                    There are various methods to find the location of
                    the binary on the server:

                    o   Use 'which':

                        The 'which' command can be executed in a shell
                        to display the full path to an application if it
                        exists:

                        shell> which unrar
                        /usr/local/bin/unrar

                    o   Using 'locate':

                        The 'locate' utility allows you to search
                        quickly for files on your server containing a
                        string you specify:

                        shell> locate unrar
                        /usr/local/bin/unrar
                        /usr/local/share/doc/unrar
                        /usr/local/share/doc/unrar/license.txt
                        -snip-

                        Note: you must have a locate database built to
                        be able to use the locate command.  See the
                        manpage for locate on your system - 'man
                        locate'.

                    o   Using your package management system:

                        Most package management systems include a
                        utility that can describe what files are
                        installed by a package.

                        For example on FreeBSD, the 'pkg_info' utility
                        can be used with the -L switch to describe what
                        files are installed by a package:

                        shell> pkg_info -L unrar-3.70.b7,4
                        Information for unrar-3.70.b7,4:

                        Files:
                        /usr/local/bin/unrar
                        /usr/local/share/doc/unrar/license.txt
                        /usr/local/share/doc/unrar/readme.txt

                    The following binary paths are configured on the
                    server admin page:

                    o   transmissioncli

                        Transmission is a torrent client which can be
                        used as an alternative to bittorrent or
                        bittornado. Release-Tarballs include a cli-
                        version of transmissioncli written to be used
                        with torrentflux-b4rt. This version has only
                        some additions specific to tfb-operation and
                        is using an unmodified "libtransmission".
                        (exact version of libtransmission can be found
                        in the file transmission.revision or in help-
                        page of transmissioncli)

                        The modified transmission source can be
                        found in the 'clients/transmission' folder -
                        once extracted, build and install it to your
                        desired location.

                        It must be built and installed on
                        the system on which you are running it before it
                        can be used.

                    o   wget

                        Wget transfers can be controlled using
                        torrentflux-b4rt.

                    o   uudeview

                        uudeview is required for the operation of the
                        nzbperl component of torrentflux-b4rt.

                    o   php

                        This is the commandline (cli) PHP binary, not to be
                        confused with the PHP web installation!  You
                        must have a working cli php binary for many
                        features of torrentflux-b4rt to work correctly.

                        Note that the php cgi binary WILL NOT work as a
                        replacement to the php cli binary.

                        On most OS's, the package management system will
                        allow you to install a php cli binary as well as
                        a web based php component (mod_php/php cgi
                        binary).  See your package management package
                        database for info.

                    o   python

                        Python is used by the BitTorrent and BitTornado
                        torrent clients and is requisite for the most basic
                        operation of torrentflux-b4rt as a torrent
                        controller.

                        There are various additional python related
                        dependencies required for BitTorrent to work
                        fully, see the README file in the
                        torrentflux-b4rt distribution root directory for
                        more info.

                    o   perl

                        Perl is used by various features in
                        torrentflux-b4rt.  There are various perl
                        related dependencies required for these features
                        to work fully, see the README file in the
                        torrentflux-b4rt distribution root directory for
                        more info.

                    o   grep

                        Basic userland binary that is included in most
                        modern Unix type OS's.

                    o   awk

                        Basic userland binary that is included in most
                        modern Unix type OS's.

                    o   du

                        Basic userland binary that is included in most
                        modern Unix type OS's.

                    o   unzip

                        Unzip is used in the directory manager frontend
                        in torrentflux-b4rt for extracting zip archives
                        on the server.  Unzip can be found in most
                        package management systems on Unix type systems.

                    o   cksfv

                        cksfv is used in the directory manager frontend
                        in torrentflux-b4rt for checking the integrity
                        of transferred content against an included .sfv
                        file.  Cksfv can be found in most package
                        management systems on Unix type systems.

                    o   vlc

                        VLC can be used to stream avi content directly
                        from the torrentflux-b4rt server where the
                        content is located.  VLC can be found in most
                        package management systems on Unix type systems.

                    o   unrar

                        Unrar is used in the directory manager frontend
                        in torrentflux-b4rt for extracting zip archives
                        on the server.  Unrar can be found in most
                        package management systems on Unix type systems.

                Operating system specific configuration

                    There are a small number of applications that are
                    specific to different operating systems -
                    applications that only exist on one type of OS.

                    The OS specifics, by OS, are as follows:

                    o   Linux:

                        *   loadavg

                            Used to determine server load average for
                            display in torrentflux-b4rt frontend stats.

                        *   netstat

                            Used to determine network connection stats for
                            display in torrentflux-b4rt frontend.

                            netstat is a native app on Linux and the
                            path should be detected automatically.

                    o   BSD:

                        *   sockstat

                            Used to determine network connection stats for
                            display in torrentflux-b4rt frontend.

                            sockstat is a native app on BSD and the path
                            should be detected automatically.

                            The reason for the requirement of sockstat
                            on BSD instead of netstat is that the
                            functionality of BSD's netstat does not work
                            identically to that of Linux's netstat.
                            Sockstat instead returns the information
                            required by torrentflux-b4rt correctly.

            Transfer client options (transfer)

                Overview

                    The transfer admin page allows you to configure
                    options for various transfer clients in
                    torrentflux-b4rt.  Since there are various clients
                    supported in torrentflux-b4rt, the transfer admin
                    section is split into subsections for each 'type' of
                    client - bittorrent, azureus (a special case of
                    bittorrent in torrentflux-b4rt), wget, nzbperl and
                    other settings common to all transfers.

                    In the admin section, a legend or key is used to
                    refer to each type of client.  The legend is as
                    follows:

                        B = BitTornado
                        T = Transmission
                        M = Bittorrent Mainline
                        A = Azureus

                    The client type that a setting applies to on the
                    transfer admin page is indicated in brackets, so for
                    example if a certain setting applies only to
                    BitTorrent Mainline and BitTornado, the setting will
                    have the following after it:

                    (B + M)

                    where B represents BitTornado and M represents
                    Mainline.

                    Keep this in mind when configuring settings on the
                    transfer admin page.

                BitTorrent specific settings

                    The BitTorrent specific settings are as follows:

                    o   Default BitTorrent Client
                        Set the client to use by default to start
                        torrent transfers.

                        This option determines which bittorrent client
                        should be used by default when torrents are
                        started.

                    o   Torrent Metainfo Client
                        Set the client to use to decode torrent meta data.

                        This option determines which metainfo client is
                        used to display information encoded within a
                        .torrent file.  This information is displayed
                        primarily in 'details' tab of the transfer
                        settings window for a torrent specific transfer.

                    o   Extra Commandline Options (B+T+M)

                        This option allows you to specify any additional
                        commandline options for the BitTornado/Mainline
                        or Transmission clients that aren't covered
                        elsewhere in the torrentflux-b4rt transfer admin
                        settings page.

                    o   Max Upload Rate (B+T+M+A)
                        Set the default value for the max upload rate
                        per transfer (0 for no limit).

                        This option allows you to set a global default
                        for the maximum upload rate in kB/sec.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        This limit applies only to individual transfers,
                        so if you set a maximum upload rate here of 10
                        and you have 5 torrents running in
                        torrentflux-b4rt, potentially your total maximum
                        upload rate will be 50 kB/sec.

                    o   Max Download Rate (B+T+M+A)
                        Set the default value for the max download rate
                        per transfer (0 for no limit).

                        This option allows you to set a global default
                        for the maximum download rate in kB/sec.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        As with the upload rate - this limit applies
                        only to individual transfers, so if you set a
                        maximum download rate of 10 and you have 5
                        torrents running in torrentflux-b4rt,
                        potentially your total maximum download rate
                        will be 50 kB/sec.

                    o   Max Upload Connections (B+M)
                        Set the default value for the max number of
                        upload connections per transfer (0 for no
                        limit).

                        This option determines how many concurrent
                        upload connections a single torrent process
                        will initiate.

                        This option can be useful if you have a large
                        number of torrents running and need to restrict
                        the number of open sockets you use.

                    o   Max Connections (B+M)
                        Set the maximum number of concurrent connections
                        allowed.

                        This option determines the total concurrent
                        connections for both upload and download.

                        Again, this is useful if you need to restrict
                        the total number of network connections to/from
                        your machine due to resource limitations.

                    o   Port Range (B+T+M)
                        Set the default values for the for port range
                        (min - max).

                        Note:
                        -----
                        One port is required per torrent; ensure
                        the port range is large enough for the maximum
                        number of torrents you will be running.

                        The port range you set here should be allowed
                        by any firewall you use, either on the server
                        itself or at the network perimeter (ie on your
                        modem router).

                        As mentioned, be sure to make the port range
                        large enough for your needs.  One port is
                        required for each transfer that you run, so if
                        you run 10 torrents be sure to set the port
                        range minimum and maximum at least 10 ports
                        apart.

                        When choosing Azureus as transfer-client the
                        port-setting has no affect. Azureus uses a
                        single port set in the used Azureus-Server.

                    o   Rerequest Interval (B+M)
                        Set the default value for the rerequest interval
                        to the tracker (default 1800 seconds).

                        This setting allows you to control how
                        frequently the torrent client will contact the
                        torrent tracker with updates about how much data
                        has been transferred and other information
                        related to the transfer.

                        Be careful when changing this value as it puts
                        extra load onto the remote server running the
                        tracker.

                    o   Default Torrent Completion Activity (B+T+M+A)
                        Select whether or not a torrent should keep
                        seeding when download is complete (please seed
                        your torrents).

                        This setting allows you to control what happens
                        when a torrent has finished downloading all the
                        data you requested.  Setting it to 'die when
                        done' will have the torrent stop after it's
                        completed; 'keep seeding' will carry on seeding
                        until you reach the percentage ratio you specify
                        for the torrent to stop (see below).

                        Please bear in mind it is generally considered
                        polite to continue seeding until you at least
                        meet a 100% / 1:1 ratio for a torrent - ie when
                        you have uploaded as much as you have
                        downloaded.

                    o   Default Percentage When Seeding Should Stop
                        (B+T+M+A)
                        Set the default share percentage at which
                        torrents will die if 'Keep Seeding' is selected
                        as completion activity above ('0' will seed
                        forever).

                        This setting is only applicable when 'Keep
                        Seeding' is specified as the default action to
                        take when a torrent is completed.

                        The option determines at what percentage sharing
                        ratio a transfer should stop.  For example if
                        you set this to 200 (percent), then the torrent
                        will continue seeding after it completes until
                        you have uploaded twice as much as you
                        downloaded.

                        This option is very useful for private trackers
                        who require that you maintain a certain minimum
                        sharing ratio.  If for example the default
                        minimum share ratio to maintain 'power user' level
                        on a particular tracker is 1.05 you can ensure that
                        this ratio is kept up by using the 'default
                        percentage when seeding should stop' option and set
                        it to 105 (percent).

                    o   Enable Cumulative Sharekill (B+T+M+A)
                        Recalculate the sharekill value passed to
                        clients on restart based on the total amount
                        uploaded - ie including previous sessions
                        transfer totals.

                        This option allows you to keep track of your
                        sharing ratio over a number of transfer sessions
                        for a given transfer.

                        For example, you start a torrent and it reaches
                        a 50% sharing ratio and then you stop it.
                        Without 'enable cumulative sharekill', if you
                        restart the torrent the ratio will drop back
                        down to 0% again and you will have lost track of
                        how much you have seeded the torrent over the
                        two sessions.

                        Instead, if cumulative sharekill is enabled,
                        when restarted the torrent will display 50% - ie
                        the amounts transferred in the last session are
                        remembered.

                    o   Enable File Priority (B)
                        Allow users to select which files from a torrent
                        to download.

                        This option allows your users to be able to pick
                        out individual files from a torrent and have
                        only those files download.

                        This can be very useful for example when you
                        have a torrent for a complete season of a show
                        but you only want to grab the first 2 episodes.
                        By using file prioritization you can do just
                        that, grab only the individual files you want.

                    o   Superseeder (B)
                        Set superseeder setting on torrent start by
                        default.

                        This option determines if the superseeder
                        setting is on by default for all torrents that
                        are started.

                        Superseeding is an optimisation concept that
                        allows pieces of a torrent to be uploaded
                        quickly and efficiently using as little
                        bandwidth as possible *when initially seeding a
                        torrent*.

                        For general seeding - ie when you are not the
                        initial seeder - superseeding definitely should
                        not be used.

                        See:

                        http://www.bittornado.com/docs/superseed.txt

                        for more info.

                    o   Skip HashCheck (B+M)
                        Skip hash checking by default when starting
                        torrents.

                        This option allows you to skip hash checking
                        when torrents are started up.

                        Generally a client will run a hash check on
                        downloaded data to verify the integrity of
                        it whenever the torrent is restarted.  However
                        by using this option you can disable this
                        checking.

                        This option can be useful when you are seeding
                        many large torrents whose content you are
                        certain has not changed and you need to restart
                        them all for some reason (after a server reboot
                        for example) but don't want to go through the
                        time consuming process of having hash checking
                        performed on each and every torrent.  Disabling
                        hash checking will speed up the restart process
                        here and get the torrents all seeding quickly.

                        *However*, generally you should NOT disable hash
                        checking.

                Fluazu specific settings and operation

                    Overview

                        The fluazu settings page is accessed by clicking
                        on the 'Edit Fluazu Settings' link on the
                        'transfer' admin page.  On the edit fluazu
                        settings page you can start and stop fluazu,
                        view log, process and version info and configure
                        fluazu settings.  Settings can also be changed
                        for the fluazu daemon on the fly whilst it is
                        running.

                    Starting and stopping fluazu

                        To start the fluazu daemon, click the 'Start
                        Fluazu' button.  The daemon will be started in
                        the background on the server and the status of
                        the 'Edit Fluazu Settings' page will change to
                        'Fluazu Started'.  A number of configuration
                        options for Azureus will also be displayed to
                        allow you to change these via fluazu.

                        To stop the fluazu daemon, click the 'Stop
                        Fluazu' button.  The daemon will be stopped in
                        the background on the server and the status of
                        the page will change to 'Fluazu Off'.

                    Configuring azureus settings via fluazu

                        After fluazu has been started, a number of
                        azureus options can be changed dynamically from
                        the 'Edit Fluazu Settings' page.  Making changes
                        to these options will send a command to the
                        backend azureus server to make the change.

                        The Azureus settings that can be changed via the
                        'Edit Fluazu Setting' page are as follows:

                        o   Max Active Torrents

                            Maximum torrents to run at the same time.

                        o   Max Active Torrents When Only Seeding

                            Maximum torrents to run at the same time
                            when there are only seeding torrents running
                            - ie when not leeching anything.

                        o   Max Connections Global

                            Maximum number of connections for all
                            torrents running.

                        o   Max Connections Per Torrent

                            Maximum number of connections for each
                            individual torrent.

                        o   Max Download Speed KBs

                            Maximum download speed for all torrents.

                        o   Max Downloads

                            Maximum number of downloads to run
                            consecutively.

                        o   Max Upload Speed KBs

                            Maximum upload speed for all torrents.

                        o   Max Upload Speed When Only Seeding KBs

                            Maximum upload speed to allow when only
                            seeding - ie when not leeching

                        o   Max Uploads

                            Maximum number of uploads to run
                            consecutively

                        o   Max Uploads Seeding

                            Maximum number of uploads to allow when
                            seeding.

                    Viewing information about fluazu - logs, processes,
                    version

                        To view the fluazu log entries, click on the
                        'logs' link.  A new page will open with the
                        current fluazu logfile in it.

                        To view the process listing information for the
                        fluazu daemon, click on the 'ps' link.  A new
                        page will open containing the process listing
                        info if available.

                        To view the version information for the
                        currently installed fluazu daemon, click the
                        'version' link.  A new page will open containing
                        the version details.

                    Configuring fluazu

                        The following options are configured on the
                        'Edit Fluazu Settings' page:

                        o   Host

                            Host of Azureus-server (currently only
                            localhost is supported).

                        o   Port

                            Port of Azureus-server (XML/HTTP, default:
                            6884).

                        o   Secure

                            Use secure connection to azureus.

                        o   Username

                            Username to use when connecting to
                            Azureus-server.

                        o   Password

                            Password to use when connecting to
                            Azureus-server.

                Wget specific settings

                    The wget specific settings are as follows:

                    o   Enable Wget
                        Set who can use wget.

                        By default torrentflux-b4rt is set to allow all
                        users to use the wget functionality.  If you
                        wish to restrict access to wget, you can do so
                        here.

                    o   Limit Download Rate
                        Set the default value for the max download rate
                        per transfer (0 for no limit).

                    o   Limit Number of Retries
                        Set the max number of retries to attempt (0 for
                        no limit).

                        When accessing a URL resource using wget and the
                        URL is unavailable for some reason, this option
                        specifies how many times wget should continue to
                        retry getting the resource.

                    o   Enable Passive FTP
                        Enable/disable "passive" transfer mode for FTP.

                        In passive ftp transfer mode, the transfer
                        client determines the port it uses to
                        communicate with the remote server.  In active
                        mode, the server determines the ports used to
                        communicate.  Changing the transfer mode can
                        help with communication problems because of
                        restrictive firewalls - the subject is beyond
                        the scope of this document.

                Nzbperl specific settings

                    The requirements for using nzbperl can be checked by
                    clicking on the 'nzbperl Requirements Check' link.
                    The requirements checker script for nzbperl will run
                    in a new window and list all the elements required
                    to run nzbperl and whether your current server
                    installation meets those requirements.

                    The nzbperl specific settings are as follows:

                    o   Enable Nzbperl
                        Set who can use nzbperl.

                        By default access to the nzbperl functionality
                        is disabled. If you wish to change access rights
                        to nzbperl, you can do so here.

                    o   Use Subdirectories
                        Download nzbperl content into separate
                        subdirectories.

                        By default nzbperl will download all content
                        into the master nzb directory.  If you wish to
                        have content downloaded into individual
                        subdirectories for each transfer, you can do
                        that here.

                    o   Bad File Action
                        Set the action to perform on finding a bad entry
                        in the nzb.

                        By default nzbperl will drop any bad files
                        downloaded and attempt to re-transfer them.
                        This option can be changed here.

                    o   Download Rate
                        Set the default value for the max download rate
                        per transfer (0 for no limit).

                    o   Server
                        Set the NNTP server nzbperl should connect to.

                    o   Username
                        Set the username to use when connecting to your
                        NNTP server.

                    o   Password
                        Set the password to use when connecting to your
                        NNTP server.

                    o   Connections
                        The number of simultaneous connections to the
                        NNTP server nzbperl will create.

                        Note:
                        You can only run conn/server_max nzb downloads at once.

                    o   Threads
                        Use threading.

                        Note:
                        Enable only if your Perl installation supports threads.

                    o   Extra Commandline Options

                        Any extra commandline options you wish to pass
                        to the nzbperl process can be set here.  Refer
                        to the nzbperl documentation for more
                        information on this TODO_LINK:nzbperl website

                Common settings

                    The common settings available for configuration are:

                    o   Enable 0000 Umask (B+T+M+W+N)
                        Enable/disable setting umask to 0000 when
                        starting a client.

                        Note:
                        Resulting permissions of created files will be
                        777 - readable, writable and executable by
                        everyone.

                        Umasking refers to the default file permissions
                        that should be given to a newly created file.
                        This option will set the umask to 0000 which
                        will give all files created by all transfer
                        processes a default permission so the files are
                        readable/writable by everyone.

                        See the manpage for 'sh' for more info on umask.

                    o   Use Nice (B+T+M+W+N)
                        Set the nice level to use for transfer
                        processes.

                        Note:
                        The highest nice level - 19 - gives processes
                        the lowest possible priority over other
                        processes on the server.

                        The nice utility is a feature of Unix type OSs
                        that allows you to adjust the priority of a
                        process.  The higher a process's 'nice' value is
                        the less priority it has with respect to access
                        to OS system resources - memory paging, CPU
                        access, etc.  By setting a high nice value you
                        are being 'nice' to the other processes on a
                        server.

                        This option is useful in the case you have a
                        multi-purpose server and you don't want
                        torrentflux-b4rt created processes to take all
                        the resources up - setting a high nice value
                        here will effectively give other processes on
                        the webserver higher priority.

            Transfer control settings (control)

                Overview

                    The 'control settings' tab ('control') on the admin
                    pages allows you to specify settings related to the
                    control of transfers in torrentflux-b4rt.

                Configuration

                    The settings available on the 'control' tab are as
                    follows:

                    o   Customize Transfer Settings
                        Define who can customize transfer settings.

                        This option allows you to determine who can
                        modify the transfer settings when starting a
                        transfer - ie max upload/download rate, max
                        connections, completion activity, port
                        configuration, etc.

                        Access to the transfer settings customization
                        functionality can be configured as follows:

                        *   Only Admins - only admins can modify
                            transfer settings.

                        *   All Users - all users can modify transfer
                            settings.

                        *   Disabled - customization of transfer
                            settings is disabled.

                    o   Transfer Profiles
                        Define who can use transfer profiles.

                        Transfer profiles allow users to configure
                        different profiles for different transfer
                        requirements.  TODO_LINK: see user operation
                        section - Transfer profile management

                        Access to the transfer profile functionality can
                        be configured as follows:

                        *   All Users - all users can create and use the
                            transfer profile functionality.

                        *   Only Predefined - only predefined transfer
                            profiles can be used.  Create transfer
                            profiles as admin first.

                        *   Only Admins - only admins can create and use
                            transfer profiles.

                        *   Disabled - transfer profile functionality is
                            disabled.

                    o   Enable Client Chooser
                        When enabled, allow users to choose which
                        transfer client to use.

                    o   Enable Save Path Chooser
                        When enabled, displays a directory tree to allow
                        users to downloaded transfers to any existing
                        folder under their home directory.

                        With this option enabled, each recursive
                        subdirectory within the user's configured home
                        directory will be displayed in a directory tree
                        list, up to 'max depth' levels deep.

                        The user can then choose one of those
                        directories as the location to save newly
                        transferred content to.

                    o   Save Path Chooser Max Depth
                        Set the maximum depth of subfolders to display
                        in the save path chooser directory tree (set to
                        '0' to display all subfolders).

                        If 'enable save path chooser' is enabled, the
                        list of directories displayed in the save path
                        chooser will drill down by default as far as
                        necessary to display all recursive folders.

                        If you have a large number of complex folder
                        structures within the user's home directories,
                        you can change the depth to which the 'save path
                        chooser' drills down by changing this option.

            Web application frontend options (webapp)

                Overview

                    The 'WebApp Settings' (webapp) tab on the admin
                    pages allows you to configure settings related to
                    the torrentflux-b4rt frontend.

                Configuration

                    The configuration options for the webapps tab are as
                    follows:

                    o   Select Authentication Type
                        Select which authentication method
                        torrentflux-b4rt uses for user login.

                        This option allows you to decide how users will
                        authenticate to login to the torrentflux-b4rt
                        frontend.  There are five different options to
                        choose from:

                        *   Form Auth
                            Standard form based authentication.

                            This is the default authentication method.
                            Users will have to complete and submit a login
                            form with their username and password at the
                            start of each new browser session to be able
                            to login to the frontend.

                        *   Form Auth + Cookie
                            Standard form based authentication using an
                            'autologin' cookie (expires after 30 days).

                            This method is similar to the default 'Form
                            Auth', except that the user will have the
                            option to check a checkbox to allow them to
                            stay logged in across browser sessions -
                            'Remember Me' functionality.

                            This method uses a client side cookie to store
                            the autologin information.  Information is
                            stored using a hashing algorithm so that
                            details are not directly readable in plain
                            text.

                        *   Form Auth + Image
                            Standard form based authentication using image
                            based captcha validation (user must enter the
                            characters displayed in a dynamically created
                            image to validate).

                            This option enables the use of Captchas as an
                            added form of protection against automated
                            brute force attacks.  Using captchas, the user
                            is required to type in the characters
                            displayed in a dynamically generated image
                            before being allowed to login.  This is
                            required the first time the user browses to
                            the torrentflux-b4rt frontend in any given
                            browser session.

                        *   Basic Auth
                            Use HTTP Basic Authentication scheme
                            (browser will handle user/password input).

                            This option uses the standard HTTP basic
                            authentication method to log users in.

                            The torrentflux-b4rt login page sends a
                            'HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized' HTTP header to
                            the browser/user agent which should prompt
                            the browser to display a username/password
                            dialogue box for the user to enter their
                            credentials in.  When this dialogue box is
                            submitted, the credentials are then
                            compared to the credentials stored in the
                            torrentflux-b4rt database.  If the
                            credentials match, the user is logged in.

                        *   Basic Auth + Passthrough
                            Pass the credentials of a user authenticated
                            externally via basic auth to the webapp.

                            This method can be used when authentication
                            is to be performed against another user
                            database other than the default
                            torrentflux-b4rt db - for example using the
                            apache webserver's built in authentication
                            modules or some third party authentication
                            module.

                            Using this method, the webserver is
                            responsible for performing the
                            authentication initially.  If the
                            credentials are accepted by the webserver,
                            they are then passed on to the
                            torrentflux-b4rt login mechanism where the
                            credentials are again checked, this time
                            against the torrentflux-b4rt database.
                            If this check is successful, the user is
                            logged in.

                            Note:
                            -----
                            To logout from torrentflux-b4rt whilst using
                            the 'Basic Auth + Passthrough' method, the
                            user must end the current browser session -
                            ie terminate all instances of the current
                            web browser session.

                            This has the effect of logging the user out
                            - when the user starts a new browser session
                            and browses to the torrentflux-b4rt
                            frontend, they will be required to login
                            again.

                            TODO_LINK: Link to some basic auth guide,
                            apache site or apache week?


                    o   Basic Authentication Realm
                        Specify the realm name to use if Basic
                        Authentication method is used.

                        This option sets which realm to use when using
                        basic authentication methods. A realm defines a
                        particular area of a website that the basic
                        authentication scheme protects or applies to.

                        The realm name configured here will be displayed
                        in the basic auth dialogue box displayed when a
                        user logs in.

                    o   Default Page Title
                        Specify the default page title.

                        This is the default page title displayed in the
                        HTML title tags for the torrentflux-b4rt index
                        page.  Web browsers will typically display the
                        text contained in the HTML title tags for a web
                        page in the title bar of the browser window.

                    o   Enable Personal Settings
                        Allow users to change their personal settings.

                        This option allows users to modify their
                        personal settings via the 'Profile' page.

                        The 'tf' style bar displays a drivespace bar on
                        the index page where the length of the bar
                        indicates how much disk space has been used on
                        the hard disk mount point where the .transfers
                        folder is located.  The amount of free space in
                        MB/Gb and as a percentage of the total is also
                        displayed in text next to the drivespace bar.

                        The 'xfer' style bar displays a drivespace bar
                        where the length of the bar indicates how much
                        disk space is left available (instead of how
                        much is actually used in the case of the 'tf'
                        style bar).

                    o   Transfer Statistics Update Method
                        Choose the method used to update the transfer
                        statistics window.

                        The 'Stats' page for a transfer - displayed by
                        clicking on the transfer in the transfer list
                        and then clicking the 'Stats' tab - is
                        automatically updated to display stats in near
                        real time.

                        The method used to update the stats can be set
                        using this option.  There are two options - AJAX
                        or HTML Meta Refresh.

                        AJAX is the default update method.

                        Tip:
                        ----
                        AJAX updates uses less bandwidth since only the
                        relevant data in the stats page is transferred.

                        Alternatively, the HTML Meta Refresh update
                        method will transfer the complete stats webpage
                        from the webserver using a little more bandwidth
                        than AJAX.

                    o   Transfer Statistics Update Interval
                        Specify the interval in seconds between updates
                        in the transfer statistics window.

                    o   Resolve Hostnames In Transfer Window Hosts Tab
                        Whether to resolve transfer peer hostnames to IP
                        addresses in the Hosts tab of the transfer
                        window - selecting Hostnames will add load to
                        the server.

                        By default, torrentflux-b4rt does not resolve IP
                        addresses (ie 1.2.3.4) into fully qualified
                        domain names (ie example.com).  This option
                        enables the resolution of IP addresses to domain
                        names.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        This option increases the load on the server,
                        both in terms of CPU processing and network
                        resources and should be used with caution
                        especially on servers with a large number of
                        transfers running at the same time.

                    o   Server Monitor Update Interval
                        Specify the interval in seconds between updates
                        in the Server Monitor window.

                        The server monitor displays statistics relating
                        to the webserver running torrentflux-b4rt.  This
                        option defines how often the server monitor
                        window is updated.

                        For more information on the server monitor, see:

                        TODO_LINK: user ops, Opening the server monitor

                    o   Hide Referer When Following Links
                        When enabled, referer information will not be
                        forwarded to websites visited by clicking on
                        links within torrentflux-b4rt.

                        This option is enabled by default and stops the
                        browser sending the URL of the page from which
                        the user came from - the 'referer' URL.

                    o   Default Theme
                        Select the default theme.

                        Note: This theme will also be used for the login
                        screen when a form based authentication method
                        is used.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        This option will set the default theme for all
                        new users.  Current user's theme settings will
                        not be modified.

                    o   Default Language
                        Select the default language.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        This option will set the default language for
                        all new users.  Current user's language settings
                        will not be modified.

                    o   Days To Keep Logged Audit Actions
                        Number of days that audit actions will be held
                        in the database.

                        By default, audit actions are stored in the
                        database for 30 days.  After this time the
                        entries are pruned from the database.

                        For more information on viewing Audit Actions,
                        see:

                        TODO_LINK: user ops, Viewing activity history
                        admin ops, Activity / Audit / Event viewer
                        (activity)

                    o   Minutes To Keep User Online Status
                        Number of minutes after ending a browser session
                        that user status changes to offline.

                        Torrentflux-b4rt displays a list of all users
                        currently 'online' at any one time in the
                        'users' panel in the frontend.  This option sets
                        how long in minutes after a user ends a browser
                        session to mark the user as being 'offline'.

                        The default is 3 minutes.

                    o   Minutes To Cache RSS Feeds
                        Number of minutes to cache RSS XML feeds on the
                        server.

                        Torrentflux-b4rt caches RSS feeds for users to
                        browse via the 'RSS Torrents' link on the index
                        page to save on network traffic and processing.

                        This option allows you to configure how long to
                        wait before requesting new copies of the RSS
                        feeds to 'refresh' the cache.

                        The default is to cache RSS feeds for 20
                        minutes.

                        Warning:
                        --------
                        Setting the cache to a very low value so the RSS
                        feeds are refreshed more often can lead to a ban
                        on your IP address if the server where the RSS
                        feed is requested from sees you as 'hammering'.

                        You should consult the tracker website's rules
                        before setting the cache timeout to a very low
                        value.

                    o   Enable Template Cache
                        Enable caching of HTML template files.

                        Torrentflux-b4rt can cache the HTML template
                        files displayed for users by setting this
                        option.  This can significantly improve the
                        speed at which pages are displayed in the
                        browser.

                        Template caching is disabled by default.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        This option should be used with caution - if
                        'stale' pages or other glitches are observed
                        when using template caching, the cache can be
                        flushed:

                        TODO_LINK:user ops, Flushing the template cache

                    o   Debug Level
                        Set the debug level - higher values increase the
                        debugging output in the logs.

                        The verbosity of logging messages emitted by
                        torrentflux-b4rt can be increased by setting
                        this value higher - 0 is lowest, 2 is highest.
                        This option is especially useful when
                        troubleshooting the operation of
                        torrentflux-b4rt and should be set to the
                        highest value before requesting support.

                        The default debugging level is '0'.

                    o   Show SQL Debug Statements
                        SQL Errors will always be displayed but when
                        this feature is enabled the SQL Statement that
                        caused the error will be displayed as well.

            Web application index page display options (index)

                Overview

                    The 'Index Settings' (index) tab on the admin
                    pages allows you to configure settings related to
                    the display of the torrentflux-b4rt index page in
                    the frontend.

                Configuration

                    The configuration options for the index tab are as
                    follows:

                    o   Page Refresh
                        Enable/disable page updates using HTML meta
                        refresh.

                        The index page will be refreshed using an HTML
                        meta refresh tag when this option is enabled.

                        Tip:
                        ----
                        AJAX updates uses less bandwidth since only the
                        relevant data in the stats page is transferred.

                        Alternatively, the HTML Meta Refresh update
                        method will transfer the complete stats webpage
                        from the webserver using a little more bandwidth
                        than AJAX.

                    o   Page Refresh Interval
                        Interval in seconds between page refreshes.

                    o   AJAX Update
                        Enable/disable page updates using AJAX.

                    o   Page Title AJAX Update
                        Enable/disable update of page titles using AJAX.

                        Tip:
                        ----
                        This option is useful because torrentflux-b4rt
                        displays various statistics in the page title,
                        which in turn are displayed in the task bar on
                        Windows.  This makes it easy to see at a glance
                        how transfers and the server is performing.

                    o   Users AJAX Update
                        Enable/disable update of user list using AJAX.

                        The user list displays which torrentflux-b4rt
                        users are currently online.  This option updates
                        the user list dynamically using AJAX.

                    o   Transfer List AJAX Update
                        Enable/disable update of transfer list using
                        AJAX.

                        The transfer list can be updated using AJAX
                        with this option.

                    o   Silent AJAX Update
                        Do not display any processing request messages
                        when AJAX updates are in progress. Countdown to
                        update timer will also not be displayed.

                        Usually torrentflux-b4rt will display a
                        'Processing...' messages when an update is in
                        effect to indicate to the user that they should
                        not click on anything since the system is busy.
                        This option will disable the processing
                        messages.

                    o   AJAX Update Interval
                        Interval in seconds between AJAX updates.

                    o   Width
                        Width of the index page in pixels.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        If a large number of transfer list columns are
                        selected for display, the width of the transfer
                        list may exceed the default page width selected
                        here.  As a result, the index page width may be
                        larger than the width selected here if you have
                        a large number of transfer list columns on
                        display.

                    o   Multi Uploads
                        Enable/disable display of links for uploading of
                        multiple files at once.

                        This option will display links underneath the
                        transfer file upload form to allow users to
                        upload multiple files at a time.

                    o   Multi Upload Page Rows
                        Number of rows of file upload fields to display
                        on the multi uploads page.

                    o   Torrent Search
                        Enable/disable torrent searches from the home
                        page via third party torrent sites.

                    o   Default Torrent Search Engine
                        Default search engine to use for torrent
                        searches.

                    o   Display Links List
                        Enable/disable display of admin configured list
                        of links on the index page.

                        The link list is configured on the 'links' admin
                        page - see here for more info:

                        TODO_LINK:
                        Admin ops, Website link list management (links)

                    o   Display Users List
                        Enable/disable display of torrentflux-b4rt users
                        and their online status.

                        When enabled, a list of all torrentflux-b4rt
                        users is displayed showing their current online
                        status.

                        The period of time after which users are
                        considered 'offline' is configured on the
                        'webapp' admin page, see here for more info:

                    o   Good Looking Statistics
                        Enable/disable display of good looking
                        statistics - up/download speeds, connections,
                        drivespace and server load statistics.

                        This option enables the display of various
                        statistics on the index page.

                    o   Good Looking Statistics Display Settings
                        Select the items to display in the "Good Looking
                        Statistics" panel.

                        *	Download Speed - total download speed being
                            used by torrentflux-b4rt.

                        *	Upload Speed - total upload speed being
                            used by torrentflux-b4rt.

                        *	Total Speed - total speed (up and down)
                            being used by torrentflux-b4rt.

                        *	Connections - total number of transfers
                            running.

                        *	Drive Space - total drive space remaining on
                            the mount point where the transfers folder
                            is located.

                        *	Server Load - the load averages for the
                            server.  Uses results from 'loadavg' on
                            linux or 'uptime' on BSD.

                    o   Bandwidth Bars
                        Enable/disable display of current bandwidth
                        usage bars.

                        When enabled, bars will be displayed to indicate
                        the current upload and download bandwidth being
                        utilised.  The longer the bar, the more
                        bandwidth in use.

                    o   Bandwidth Bars Style
                        Select the style of bandwidth bar to use.

                        There are two bar styles to choose from - tf and
                        xfer.  The tf style has a constant color,
                        whereas the xfer style turns redder the higher
                        the bandwidth utilization is.

                    o   Upstream Bandwidth
                        Maximum available upstream bandwidth in kilobits
                        per second (kbit/s) through your ISP - 1 Megabit
                        per second (1Mbit/s) is roughly equal to
                        1000kbit/s.

                        This figure is used to determine the percentage
                        utilization of bandwidth in the bandwidth bars.
                        You should enter the maximum available upstream
                        bandwidth for the network connection of the
                        server - usually this will be the max bandwidth
                        you get from your ISP.

                        Tip:
                        ----
                        A rough guide to bandwidth figures:

                        1000 = roughly 1Mbit/s
                        512 = 512kbit/s

                    o   Downstream Bandwidth
                        Maximum available downstream bandwidth in
                        kilobits per second (kbit/s) through your ISP -
                        1 Megabit per second (1Mbit/s) is roughly equal
                        to 1000kbit/s.

                        This figure is used to determine the percentage
                        utilization of bandwidth in the bandwidth bars.
                        You should enter the maximum available downstream
                        bandwidth for the network connection of the
                        server - usually this will be the max bandwidth
                        you get from your ISP.

                    o   Big Bold Drivespace Warning
                        Enable/disable display of "Big Bold Drivespace"
                        warning when disk space gets below 2% of total.

                    o   Only Admin Can See Other User's Transfers
                        Enable/disable visibility of other user's
                        transfers in regular user's transfer lists -
                        when enabled, only admins will be able to see
                        other user's transfers in their transfer list.

                    o   Transfer File Download
                        Enable/disable links in the transfer list to
                        allow users to download transfer files from the
                        server.

                        This option will add a link to the left of each
                        transfer in the transfer list so that the
                        transfer file (ie .torrent file) can be
                        downloaded.  When the link is clicked, the
                        transfer file will be sent to the user as an
                        attachment - ie the browser will prompt the user
                        to save the file locally (or open it in an
                        associated application if MIME types are
                        configured correctly).

                    o   Display Seeding Torrents
                        Enable/disable display of torrents in the
                        seeding state - if enabled, when a torrent has
                        finished leeching and moves on to seed, the
                        torrent will be hidden from the transfer list.
                        Hidden torrents can be viewed in the transfer
                        list by clicking the 'Show Seeding Torrents'
                        link under the transfer list.

                    o   Display Estimated Time To Seed
                        Enable/disable display of estimated time until a
                        transfer is completed in the transfer list.

                    o   Transfer List Can Be Sorted
                        Enable/disable sorting of the transfer list -
                        when enabled, users will be able to change the
                        order in which the transfer list is displayed
                        based on date added, file name, size, totals
                        up/down, transfer status, etc.

                        Tip:
                        ----
                        To change the sort order of the transfer list,
                        click on the column headers at the top of the
                        transfer list.  Each click on the column header
                        will toggle sorting in ascending/descending
                        order for that column type.

                        For example, clicking on the 'Transfer File'
                        column header will sort the transfer list by
                        transfer file name alphabetically ascending
                        (A-Z); clicking again on the 'Transfer File'
                        column header will sort the transfer list by
                        transfer file name alphabetically descending
                        (Z-A).

                    o   Default Sort Order
                        Select the default property by which the items
                        in the transfer list should be sorted by.

                        This is the column by which all transfers in the
                        transfer list will be sorted by - for example,
                        to have the transfer list automatically sorted
                        by transfer file name alphabetically, select
                        'Name - Ascending'.

                    o   Transfer List Display Settings
                        Select the types of columns to display for each
                        transfer in the transfer list.

                        *	Owner
                        *	Size
                        *	Total Down
                        *	Total Up
                        *	Status
                        *	Progress
                        *	Down-Speed
                        *	Up-Speed
                        *	Seeds
                        *	Peers
                        *	Estimated Time
                        *	Client

                        This option allows you to see a whole host of
                        information directly in the transfer list
                        without having to click on a transfer to pop up
                        the transfer window.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        The more transfer columns you display in the
                        transfer list, the wider the index page will
                        grow.  Take this into account especially when
                        using a screen with lower resolutions.

                    o   Default Transfer Window
                        Select the default page to display in the
                        transfer window - the window which is displayed
                        when a transfer in the transfer list is clicked
                        on.

                        This option allows you to choose which tab of
                        the popup transfer window will be displayed
                        when you click on a transfer in the transfer
                        list.

                    o   Multi Operations
                        Enable/disable display of the dropdown list of
                        operations to perform on multiple transfer list
                        items - when enabled, a list of operations
                        (start/stop/delete/wipe/reset) will be available
                        in a drop down list for users to perform on more
                        than one transfer at a time.

                        This option allows you to specify whether you
                        want users to be able to use the multi ops
                        feature.  Multi ops allow users to select a
                        number of transfers from the transfer list and
                        then apply an action to all of those selected
                        transfers only - start, stop, delete, etc.

                    o   Bulk Operations
                        Enable/disable display of bulk operation links -
                        when enabled, links will be displayed on the
                        index page to allow users to control
                        (start/stop/resume) all transfer in the transfer
                        list at once.

                        This option allows you to specify whether the
                        bulk ops links will be displayed on the index
                        page.

                        Bulk ops allow users to perform an action on
                        every single transfer in the transfer list at
                        once - for example to restart all torrents in
                        one go.

                    o   Display Server Statistics
                        Enable/disable display of various server
                        statistics (transfer/queue/server stats) at the
                        bottom of the index page.

                    o   Display Network Connections
                        Enable/disable display of total network
                        connections on the index page.

                    o   Display Server Load
                        Enable/disable display of 1/5/15 minute average
                        server load on the index page.

            Directory / File Management options (dir)

                Overview

                    The 'Dir Settings' (dir) tab on the admin pages
                    allows you to configure settings related to the
                    torrentflux-b4rt file and directory manager -
                    referred to as 'dir manager' from now on.

                    TODO_LINK: user ops, dir manager section

                Configuration

                    The configuration options for the dir tab are as
                    follows:

                    o   Public Read
                        Enable/disable public read permission for all
                        files/folders in torrentflux-b4rt - when
                        enabled, all files and folders within
                        torrentflux-b4rt will be readable by all
                        torrentflux-b4rt users.

                        This option makes all files transferred using
                        torrentflux-b4rt visible to all torrentflux-b4rt
                        users - admin and normal users alike.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        This does *not* make the files automatically
                        visible to all Unix users on the webserver where
                        torrentflux-b4rt is installed.

                        Tip:
                        ----
                        To make downloaded files accessible to Unix
                        users other than the webserver user - for
                        example so a 'regular' Unix user can download
                        the transferred files via FTP:

                        1.  When the transfer is complete, use the
                            'chmod' torrentflux-b4rt functionality to
                            change the mode of the transferred files to
                            '777' - ie readable by everyone .

                        2.  In the LINK_TODO:[admin.dir.move dir tab of
                            the admin pages], add the target directory
                            owned by the Unix user who will be
                            downloading files via FTP as a valid move
                            path.  This will allow files to be moved
                            from torrentflux-b4rt into the target
                            directory.

                        3.  Move the files out of the torrentflux-b4rt
                            transfer directory into the target directory
                            owned by the Unix user who will be
                            downloading the files via FTP.  Ensure the
                            webserver user has permissions to write
                            files to the target directory.

                            The files should now be available for the
                            Unix user to download via FTP.

                            Note:

                            Any problems encountered whilst using this
                            method will almost always come down to Unix
                            file permissions - make sure the webserver
                            can write to the Unix user's target
                            directory and in turn make sure the file
                            permissions of the moved files are
                            sufficient for the Unix user to access them
                            once they're moved.

                    o   Public Write
                        Enable/disable public write permission for all
                        files/folders in torrentflux-b4rt - when
                        enabled, all files and folders within
                        torrentflux-b4rt will be writable by all
                        torrentflux-b4rt users.

                        By default, files and folders in
                        torrentflux-b4rt are only writable by the
                        torrentflux-b4rt user that created them.  This
                        option overrides this so that any
                        torrentflux-b4rt user can write to any other
                        torrentflux-b4rt user's files/folders.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        This feature only applies to torrentflux-b4rt
                        users - Unix users on the system will not be
                        automatically given write permissions to
                        torrentflux-b4rt files by enabling the 'Public
                        Write' option in torrentflux-b4rt.

                        Warning:
                        --------
                        Enabling the 'Public Write' option is a security
                        risk to other torrentflux-b4rt users - only
                        enable it on a server where all torrentflux-b4rt
                        users are 'trusted'.  Of course the definition of
                        'trusted' will vary from one system to another.

                    o   Chmod
                        Enable/disable the use of the chmod
                        functionality for regular torrentflux-b4rt users
                        - when enabled, users will be able to change the
                        permissions on files and folders in
                        torrentflux-b4rt to read/write/execute for
                        everyone (777).

                        This option will enable users to click a link in
                        the dir manager to set the file permissions on
                        the associated file to '777' -
                        read/write/executable for *all Unix users*.

                        Warning:
                        --------
                        Enabling the 'Chmod' option is a system wide
                        security risk - any Unix user on the server
                        hosting torrentflux-b4rt will have read, write
                        and execute permissions on files and directories
                        chmod'ed.  Sensitive files should not be
                        chmod'ed 777 and if you do not trust your users
                        to use the chmod functionality correctly you
                        should not enable it.

                    o   Full Directory Listings
                        Enable/disable complete directory listings -
                        when enabled, full directory listings will be
                        used including size and last modified time
                        similar to Unix 'ls -al' output.

                    o   Make Torrent
                        Enable/disable make torrent functionality for
                        users - when enabled, users will be allowed to
                        create torrent files from the contents in the
                        directory manager.

                        When enabled, an 'make torrent' icon will be
                        available next to files in the dir manager so
                        users will be able to create torrents from files
                        and directories in the dir manager.

                    o   Default Make Torrent Client
                        Choose the default client to use to create
                        torrent files with.

                        The options available are: BitTornado (tornado)
                        or BitTorrent Mainline (mainline).

                    o   File Downloads
                        Enable/disable file downloading from the
                        directory manager - when enabled, users will be
                        able to download files directly from the
                        torrentflux-b4rt file manager.

                        When enabled, a download icon will be displayed
                        next to files and directories in the dir
                        manager to allow users to download the files as
                        a zip or tar archive - depending on the setting
                        for 'Download Archive Type'.

                    o   Download Archive Type
                        Choose the type of archive to use when
                        performing file downloads - files downloaded
                        will be archived using this archive type prior
                        to sending.

                        The available archive types are: zip or tar

                        Note:
                        -----
                        Ensure your operating system supports the
                        archive type you select here.

                        Compression is *not* used on downloaded archives.

                    o   Text/NFO Viewer
                        Enable/disable access to the built in NFO viewer
                        - when enabled, users will be able to view
                        nfo/txt/log file types directly within
                        torrentflux-b4rt.

                        When this option is enabled, files ending in
                        .nfo, .txt or .log will have a 'View NFO' icon
                        next to them in the dir manager to allow users
                        to view the (presumably text) contents directly
                        in torrentflux-b4rt.

                    o   Unrar
                        Enable/disable access to unrar functionality -
                        when enabled, users will be able to use unrar to
                        unpack rar archives directly within
                        torrentflux-b4rt.

                        When enabled, an 'unrar' icon will be displayed
                        next to rar archives in the dir manager to allow
                        users to decompress the archives directly from
                        torrentflux-b4rt.

                        Warning:
                        --------
                        Using the unrar functionality can add excessive
                        load on the server hosting torrentflux-b4rt.
                        The feature should *not* be enabled on servers
                        where resource usage is a problem or can become
                        a problem quickly.

                    o   SFV File Checking
                        Enable/disable access to sfv file checking
                        functionality - when enabled, if an sfv file is
                        present users will be able to verify the
                        integrity of the files covered by the sfv file
                        directly within torrentflux-b4rt.

                        When enabled, a 'Check SFV' icon will be
                        displayed next to any SFV files in the dir
                        manager.  Users will be able to click the link
                        to verify the integrity of the files to which
                        the sfv file is associated with.

                        Info:
                        -----
                        Simple File Verification (sfv) is a system
                        whereby a cyclic redundancy check is performed
                        on each file within a set of files and/or
                        directories.  The checksum for each file/dir is
                        then added to the 'sfv' file.

                        The sfv file is then transferred along with the
                        files it is associated with so that when
                        transfer is complete, the integrity of the files
                        can be verified by running an sfv checker
                        against them.  In this way any corruption to
                        the files that have occurred during transfer can
                        be detected and any bad files retransmitted.

                    o   VLC Streaming
                        Enable/disable access to VLC file streaming
                        functionality - when enabled, users will be able
                        to stream media directly from the webserver
                        using VLC.

                    o   VLC Port
                        Specify the port to use for VLC streaming.

                    o   File And Folder Renaming
                        Enable/disable access for users to rename files
                        and folders.

                        When enabled, an 'Rename' icon is displayed next
                        to all files and directories in the dir manager
                        to allow users to rename files.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        This option allows users to rename files *only
                        within the torrentflux-b4rt dir manager*.  To
                        move files away from the torrentflux-b4rt dir
                        manager directory structure, enable the 'File And
                        Folder Moving' option below.

                    o   File And Folder Moving
                        Enable/disable access for users to move files
                        and folders out of the torrentflux-b4rt
                        directory hierarchy - when enabled, users will
                        be allowed to move files and folders out of the
                        torrentflux-b4rt directory hierarchy into a
                        choice of folders elsewhere on the server.

                        When enabled, an 'Move' icon is displayed next
                        to all files and directories in the dir manager
                        to allow users to move files out of the
                        torrentflux-b4rt directory hierarchy elsewhere
                        on the host server.

                        This option is ideal for allowing access to
                        files and folders for normal Unix users on the
                        server hosting torrentflux-b4rt who don't have
                        permission to access the torrentflux-b4rt
                        directory hierarchy.

                        Once transfers are complete, files can be moved
                        away from the torrentflux-b4rt directory where
                        they can then be accessed via FTP, Samba or any
                        other suitable remote access protocol.

                    o   Valid File And Folder Moving Paths
                        Specify the paths to which users are allowed to
                        move files and folders outside of the
                        torrentflux-b4rt directory hierarchy.

                        List all of the folders *outside of the
                        torrentflux-b4rt directory structure* that you
                        want torrentflux-b4rt users to be allowed to
                        move files and folders to.

                        This option is redundant without enabling the
                        'File And Folder Moving' functionality above.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        Paths must be absolute - ie
                        '/path/to/somefolder' instead of just
                        'somefolder'.

                        Any newly created directories will not be
                        deleted after removing a transfer from the
                        transfer list.

                        Ensure that the target directories have
                        sufficient permissions for the webserver user to
                        create files there.

                    o   Restricted Files And Folders
                        Specify a list of patterns which, when found in
                        a file or folder name, will not be allowed
                        access to by users.

                        This option is useful if you have any files that
                        you don't want users to be able to see within
                        the dir manager.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        Access to dot files/folders - files/folders
                        starting with a dot - are always restricted.

            Configuring stats.php output options (stats)

                Overview

					The stats.php script displays statistics for various
					aspects of torrentflux-b4rt in a number of different
					output formats.  For more information on using
					stats.php, see [TODO_LINK:'appendix, Obtaining
					statistics using stats.php'].

					The operation of the stats.php script can be
					configured to your requirements - these
					configuration options are detailed in this section.

                Configuration

					The configuration options for the 'stats' tab on the
					admin pages - for configuration of the stats.php
					script - are as follows:

					o	Publicly Visible Stats
						Enable/disable publicly visible statistics - if
						enabled, superadmin level stats (server load,
						all transfer details, etc) are visible to the
						public without needing to authenticate.

						This option allows the stats.php script to be
						requested in a web browser and the output sent
						without requiring any user authentication -
						username/password credentials are not required
						to access stats output.

						Warning:
						--------
						With this option enabled, full server statistics
						will be displayed to anyone who requests them.
						As a result this should be considered a security
						risk - only enable this option if you understand
						and accept that this will reveal server loads,
						details of transfers, usernames and their online
						status and so on.  See the [TODO_LINK:'stats.php
						usage'] for more info of all information
						revealed.

					o	Show Usage When Called Without Arguments
						Enable/disable the option to display usage/help
						when the stats.php script is called without any
						arguments in the URL.

						This option displays the standard usage/help
						output when called without any arguments.

						When this option is disabled, the default action
						to perform when stats.php is called without
						arguments will be to display *all* statistics -
						ie as if the stats.php script was called with
						the argument 't=all'.

					o	Use Compression
						Enable/disable the use of compression by default
						when sending statistics - using compression uses
						less bandwidth but takes up more CPU time on the
						server

						By default compression is not used to send stats
						out from stats.php, although compression can be
						used by manually specifying the argument 'c=1'
						in the request URL to stats.php.

						This option specifies that stats.php will use
						compression by default - setting 'c=1' is not
						required in this case.

						Note:
						-----
						The compression level used is specified in the
						'Compression Level' option below.

						Using compression will add some additional
						load to the hosting server in terms of CPU
						resource usage.  In most cases this additional
						load will be negligible - the benefits of
						reducing bandwidth consumption by using
						compression should be weighed up against the
						cost of additional server load introduced.

					o	Compression Level
						Specify the level of compression to use when
						transferring data.

						Level 0 = no compression (data is sent out 'as
						is'), level 9 = maximum compression (data is
						compressed as small as possible before sending
						but takes up some minor extra CPU time to
						compress).

						This option determines the level of compression
						to use *when the stats.php script is called with
						the argument 'c=1' or compression is enabled on
						the stats admin page*.

						Compression levels run from 0 (lowest) to 9
						(highest) - ie 0 will use no compression and 9
						will use the maximum compression possible.

						The compression is applied using PHP's inbuilt
						'[TODO_LINK:@http://php.net/gzdeflate
						gzdeflate]' function.

					o	Delimiting Character To Use In TXT Mode
						Specify the character to use for
						delimiting/separating fields when the format
						type is 'txt' - this character will be used to
						split one item in the output from the next.

						By default the ';' character is used to separate
						fields in the output, ie:

						0.00;0.00;0.00;1;12.37 GB; 1.25, 1.03, 0.56;1;0;0;0;87

						where ';' marks the end of one field and the
						start of another.

						The field separator can be changed using this
						option.

					o	Send Header Fields In TXT Mode
						Enable/disable sending of header fields at the
						top of text mode output - when enabled, each of
						the statistics column headers will be sent out
						at the top of the output.

						By default when using txt output format mode
						(f=txt), the output will be sent raw without any
						column headers to indicate what each field of
						output relates to, ie:

						0.00;0.00;0.00;1;12.37 GB; 1.25, 1.03, 0.56;1;0;0;0;87

						With this option enabled, stats.php will also
						send out column headers by default whenever txt
						format is used, ie:

						Speed Down;Speed Up;Speed Total;Connections;Free Space;Load;Running;Queued;Speed Down (Percent);Speed Up (Percent);Drive Space (Percent)
						0.00;0.00;0.00;1;12.37 GB; 1.25, 1.03, 0.56;1;0;0;0;87

						This makes it easier to see what values
						represent what type of statistical information.

						Note:
						-----
						Only used in txt mode.

					o	Default Statistic Type To Send
						Specify the default type of statistic to send
						out.

						The default statistic type sent out is 'all'.
						This option allows you to change this to send
						out a different type of statistic by default.

						The options to choose from are: all, xfer,
						users, transfers.

						For more info on what is included in the output
						for each type of statistic, see
						[TODO_LINK:'the appendix section on using
						stats.php].

					o	Default Output Format
						Specify the default output format to use when
						sending statistics - rss/txt/custom xml.

						By default the format used when sending
						stats.php info out is xml.  This option allows
						you to change the default format to use.

						The option to choose from are: rss, txt, xml.

						For more info on each type of output format, see
						[TODO_LINK:'the appendix section on using
						stats.php].

					o	Send As Attachment
						Enable/disable sending of statistics as an HTTP
						attachment - browser client will prompt to save
						the attachment as a file.

						By default, stats.php will display output
						directly in the user agent as long as the agent
						is configured to do so correctly.  This option
						allows you to specify that the stats.php output
						will be sent to the user agent as an HTTP
						attachment - in most cases the user agent will
						then prompt the user to download the file and
						save it locally before viewing it.

			Guide to automatically fetching and uploading RSS torrents to torrentflux-b4rt using fluxd

				Overview

					This guide describes the steps required to configure
					the fluxd daemon to automatically check RSS torrent
					feeds for torrents matching one or more specified
                    patterns.  When a matching torrent is found it is
                    automatically downloaded to a directory.

					In turn, the fluxd daemon is configured to watch
					this auto download directory for new torrents.  When
					a new torrent is found in the watch directory, the
					torrent is automatically injected into
					torrentflux-b4rt and optionally started
					automatically.

					The guide will describe the steps required to:

                    TODO_LINK: add links to each of the sections below:
                    *	Configure the fluxd Rssad module to check RSS
                        feeds for new torrents matching a filter and
                        download them to a watch directory.

                    *   Configure the fluxd Watch module to check the
                        watch directory for new torrents and
                        automatically inject them into torrentflux-b4rt.

                    *   Configure the fluxd core and finally start
                        fluxd.

                    Important:
                    ----------
                    The RSS feeds *MUST* be 'direct download' feeds -
                    each item in the RSS feed must contain a direct link
                    to the torrent file itself and not just a link to a
                    description page for the torrent.

                    Error messages about 'URL does not appear to contain
                    a valid torrent file' or similar are often because
                    the RSS feed is not a direct download feed.

				Configuring the Rssad fluxd module to download torrents

                    Rssad configuration is split into three parts -
                    filter creation, job creation and finally setting
                    up the Rssad module to load with fluxd.  These steps
                    are covered below:

                    *   Filter creation
                        A filter is a list of patterns that Rssad uses
                        in a job to find and download new torrents
                        within RSS feeds.

                        As an example, you may have a filter called 'OS'
                        which contains a number of patterns to match
                        your favourite operating systems within RSS
                        feed(s).  When any of the patterns in the filter
                        are matched, Rssad will download the torrents
                        automatically.

                        One filter can be applied to any number of RSS
                        feeds, making it easy to search for the same
                        patterns on a number of different trackers.

                        Tip:
                        ----
                        Rssad filters are applied using the PHP function
                        preg_match() and are treated almost the same as
                        Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE), so
                        advanced regular expression metacharacter search
                        patterns can be used.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        Filter patterns are case insensitive, so the
                        pattern 'foobar' will match 'foobar', 'FOOBAR'
                        and 'FoOBaR'.

                        TODO_LINK:See the example filter section below
                        for practical examples.

                        To create a new filter:

                        *   On the 'fluxd' tab of the admin pages, click
                            the link labelled 'Configure Rssad Filters
                            And Jobs' in the Rssad section.

                        *   In the 'Name:' textbox on the 'Configure
                            Rssad Filters and Jobs' page, enter the
                            name you want to refer to the filter by.

                            The filter name is used to identify one type
                            of filter from another and should be
                            easily identifiable for you.  For example,
                            you might have a filter called 'Films' which
                            contains all the patterns of upcoming films
                            you want to keep a watch out for.

                        *   Click 'Add Filter' - you will be taken to
                            a page where you can add the patterns you
                            want to search for.

                        *   On the 'Add Filter' screen, enter the first
                            pattern you want to search for in the 'Add
                            Filter-Entry' textbox and click 'add' to add
                            the pattern to the 'Filter-Entries' list.

                            Repeat this step for each pattern you want
                            this filter to search for.

                        *   When all the patterns have been added to the
                            filter entries list, click the 'Add Filter'
                            button to save the filter.

                        The filter will now be added to the list of
                        filters available for use in Rssad jobs.

                    *   Job creation
                        With the filter added, you can now move on to
                        use it in an Rssad job.

                        An Rssad job is composed of three components:

                        *   A filter - comprising of one or more
                            patterns to search for (see above).

                        *   An RSS feed URL to apply the filter to.

                        *   A directory in which to download any torrent
                            files to if a match is made for the pattern
                            against the RSS feed.

                        To create a new Rssad job:

                        *   On the 'fluxd' tab of the admin pages, click
                            the link labelled 'Configure Rssad Filters
                            And Jobs' in the Rssad section.

                        *   Click on the 'Add Job' button on the
                            'Configure Rssad Filters And Jobs' to open
                            up the Rssad job configuration page.

                        *   On the 'Add Job' screen, enter or select the
                            following:

                            *   In the 'Savedir' textbox, enter in the
                                directory you want any found torrents to
                                be saved to.

                                The directory path should be absolute -
                                ie '/path/to/savefolder' and not just
                                'savefolder'.

                            *   Check the 'Check/Create dir' checkbox if
                                you want the 'Savedir' directory to be
                                created automatically if it doesn't
                                already exist.

                            *   In the 'URL' textbox, enter in the URL
                                of the direct download torrent RSS feed
                                you want to search in.

                                Important:
                                ----------
                                Remember, the RSS feed must be a direct
                                download feed - ie the links in the feed
                                are links to the torrent files
                                themselves and not just to a description
                                of the torrents.

                                Verify this is the case before
                                continuing to save headaches later!

                            *   Finally, select the filter you want to
                                apply to the RSS feed from the 'Filter'
                                dropdown select field.  This filter will
                                be used to search for the patterns you
                                defined in the feed URL.

                        *   Finally, click the 'Add Job' button to add
                            the job to the list of jobs that Rssad will
                            run.

                    *   Configuring the Rssad module to load up in Fluxd
                        Now the Rssad job has been added to Fluxd, all
                        that remains is to configure Fluxd to load the
                        Rssad module when it starts up and tell it how
                        often to run the job.

                        *   On the 'fluxd' admin page in the Rssad
                            section, set 'Rssad Enabled:' to 'True'.

                            This will make Fluxd load up Rssad when it
                            starts.

                        *   Change the 'Rssad Polling Interval:' to the
                            time in seconds you want to wait between
                            Rssad job runs.

                            Important:
                            ----------
                            Be careful when setting this value as some
                            trackers may ban you if you request their
                            RSS feeds too frequently.  If in doubt, ask
                            the administrators of the tracker how often
                            you can check their feeds for new items.

                        Fluxd is now configured to run the Rssad job.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        If fluxd is already running, you may need to
                        stop and restart it for the changes to take
                        effect.

                    With the steps above, Fluxd is now ready to search
                    your feed URL for the filter patterns you specified.
                    If it finds any matching torrents in the feed, they
                    will be downloaded and saved to the directory you
                    set up in the job specification.

                    If you are happy to just manually check the save
                    directory for new torrents and inject them into
                    torrentflux-b4rt manually, you can skip the next
                    section on configuring the Watch module.

                    However, if you want to use the Watch module to keep
                    an eye on the save directory and automatically
                    inject any new torrents it finds there - carry on
                    reading!

				Configuring the Watch fluxd module to inject torrents into torrentflux-b4rt

                    The Watch fluxd module can check a specified
                    directory at regular intervals and if any new
                    transfer files are found in that directory it will
                    automatically inject the transfer into
                    torrentflux-b4rt and optionally automatically start
                    it.

                    This is ideal when used in combination with the
                    Rssad module; Rssad can automatically download any
                    torrents found in an RSS feed into a directory that
                    is being watched by the Watch module and in turn the
                    Watch module can auto inject and optionally start
                    the torrent for you.

                    Watch configuration is split into two parts - watch
                    job creation and configuring the Watch module to
                    load up with fluxd:

                    *   Configure Watch Jobs
                        To configure a watch job:

                        *   On the 'fluxd' tab of the admin pages, click
                            the link labelled 'Configure Watch Jobs' in
                            the 'Watch' module section.

                        *   On the 'Configure Watch Jobs' screen, click
                            the 'Add Job' button.

                        *   On the 'Add Job' screen, enter or select the
                            following items:

                            *   Watchdir - this is the directory that
                                you want the Watch module to keep an eye
                                on for new transfer files.

                                The directory path should be absolute -
                                ie '/path/to/savefolder' and not just
                                'savefolder'.

                            *   Check the 'Check/Create dir' checkbox if
                                you want the 'Watchdir' directory to be
                                created automatically if it doesn't
                                already exist.

                            *   User - select the user you want to be
                                owner of any transfer files injected by
                                this job.

                            *   Transfer Profile - select the transfer
                                profile that will apply to any transfers
                                injected by this job.

                                TODO_LINK: See the section on transfer
                                profiles in the user ops section for
                                more info.

                        *   Finally, click on the 'Add Job' button to
                            save the job.


                    *   Configuring the Watch module to load with Fluxd
                        Watch is now configured to watch the directory
                        you specified for new transfer files and
                        automatically inject them as the user you
                        specified and with the transfer profile you set.

                        All that remains is to have the Watch module
                        load up with fluxd below:

                        *   On the 'fluxd' admin page under the 'Watch'
                            section, set 'Watch Enabled:' to 'True'.

                            This will make Fluxd load up Watch when it
                            starts.

                        *   Change the 'Watch Polling Interval:' to the
                            time in seconds you want to wait between
                            Watch job runs - ie if you set this to '120'
                            then Fluxd/Watch will check every 2 minutes
                            for new transfer files and if it finds any,
                            auto inject them into torrentflux-b4rt.

                        Fluxd is now configured to run the Watch job.

                        Note:
                        -----
                        If fluxd is already running, you may need to
                        stop and restart it for the changes to take
                        effect.

                    With the steps above, Fluxd is now ready to watch
                    the directory you specified for new transfer files
                    and auto inject them.

                    Watch is ideally used in conjunction with Rssad to
                    search for torrents, download them and drop them
                    into a directory that the Watch module is watching -
                    from where Watch can then auto inject the torrent.

                    However Watch can be used on it's own to monitor
                    directories for new transfer files - for example you
                    might always download your torrent files into a
                    certain directory and then have Watch auto inject
                    them.

				Starting fluxd

                    Finally after the Fluxd modules have been configured
                    and loaded above, you can now actually start up the
                    Fluxd daemon.  The daemon will autoload all the
                    modules you configured and the jobs will run at
                    their scheduled intervals.

                    To start Fluxd:

                    *   On the 'fluxd' admin page, modify any 'core'
                        options as required:

                        *   Database Mode - by default this is set to
                            PHP + fluxcli.php but 'Perl + DBI/DBD' can
                            be used alternatively.

                            Note:
                            -----
                            Running in perl mode is MUCH faster than
                            PHP.  However, you may need to install
                            additional perl modules to run in Perl mode
                            - check the 'check requirements' tab on the
                            superadmin pages to see if your installation
                            meets the requirements (TODO_LINK).

                        *   Loglevel - this only needs changing if you
                            experience problems and need to debug or
                            troubleshoot fluxd operation.  The default
                            loglevel is '0' (which doesn't mean 'no
                            output', just 'normal' level of output!).

                            Higher levels of loglevel increase the
                            verbosity of fluxd output.

                    *   Finally, click on the 'Start fluxd' button to
                        start the daemon in the background.

                    The status light should change to green with the
                    message 'fluxd Running' along with the process id of
                    the fluxd process.

                Example Rssad filter patterns

                    This section contains a few examples of Rssad
                    filters - regular expressions - and examples of what
                    each filter will match.  Notes are provided for each
                    example.

                    *   Pattern: ^foobar.*'

                        Matches: foobar foOBAr foobarblimp foobar...

                    *   Pattern: foobar.*s07.*

                        Matches: foobarblimpS07E01 foobarblimpS07E99
                        foobarblimpS07Complete

                        Note:
                        Useful for matching anything from season
                        07 of the 'foobar' show.

                    *   Pattern: foobar.*s0[1-3].*

                        Matches: foobarS01E01 foobarS02E01 foobarS03E01

                        Note: Useful for matching anything from seasons
                        01 through 03 of the 'foobar' show.

                    *   Pattern: foobar.*s01e0[1-9].*

                        Matches: foobarS01E01 foobarS01E02 foobarS01E09

                        Note:
                        Useful for matching anything from season 01,
                        episodes 01 through 09.

                    *   Pattern: (?!toast)foobar.*

                        Does *NOT* match: foobartoast toastfoobar
                        foobarblimptoast

                        Note:
                        Useful for matching something that does not
                        contain a certain string.  The patterns above
                        will only match if the string does not contain
                        'toast' in it.

            Obtaining statistics using stats.php

                Overview

                    Torrentflux-b4rt can output a variety of detailed
                    statistical information using TODO_LINK:[ link to
                    stats.php script, but only for the distribution html
                    manual NOT for the tfb main website version of
                    manual - is this possible with quickbook? 'the
                    stats.php script'].

                    The stats can be displayed in various formats
                    suitable for different usage purposes - plain text
                    for viewing/usage on the commandline or in a web
                    browser, RSS for reading in an RSS feed reader for
                    regular updates on the torrentflux-b4rt installation
                    or even customized XML formats for
                    specialised/custom use.

                    To view detailed usage instructions, call the
                    stats.php script with the single argument 'usage':

                            The current total number of network
                            connections.

                        http://example.com/stats.php?t=transfers

                    o   transfer
                        Displays statistics for a single transfer
                        specified using the 'i' argument.

                Specifying the format of the stats.php output

                    The type of format to use when displaying output
                    from the stats.php script is determined by the 'f'
                    argument used in the query string of the request
                    URL.

                    For example, to display statistics relating to the
                    server in RSS format, you would browse to the
                    following page:

                    http://example.com/torrentflux-b4rt/stats.php?t=server&f=rss

                    The valid options for the 'f' argument are:

                    o   xml
                        Displays output in XML format.

                    o   rss
                        Displays output in RSS 0.91 format.

                        Suitable for receiving regular updates in an RSS
                        feed reader.

                    o   txt
                        Displays output in plain text format.

                        Suitable for parsing with custom command line
                        scripts.

				Sending column headers in text mode stats.php output

					The 'h' argument to the stats.php specifies that
					header columns should be sent out with the output
					from the stats.php script (only in text format).

					For example, the plain text output generated with
					the request URL:

                    http://example.com/torrentflux-b4rt/stats.php?t=server&f=txt

					might look like this:

					0.00;0.00;0.00;1;12.37 GB; 1.25, 1.03, 0.56;1;0;0;0;87

					which is just the raw server statistics.

					Instead if we add on the argument 'h=1' to indicate
					we want column headers displayed as well - so the
					request URL looks like this:

                    http://example.com/torrentflux-b4rt/stats.php?t=server&f=txt&h=1

					then the output displayed will look like this:

					Speed Down;Speed Up;Speed Total;Connections;Free Space;Load;Running;Queued;Speed Down (Percent);Speed Up (Percent);Drive Space (Percent)
					0.00;0.00;0.00;1;12.37 GB; 1.25, 1.03, 0.56;1;0;0;0;87

					This makes it easier to tell what each field/value
					of the output represents.

					Tip:
					----

					The field separator - ';' in the example above - can
					be changed on [TODO_LINK:admin.stats 'the Admin Ops,
					Configuring stats.php page'].

					The stats.php script can also be configured to send
					out header columns by default - again on
					[TODO_LINK:admin.stats 'the Admin Ops, Configuring
					stats.php page'].

				Sending stats.php output as HTTP file attachments

					The 'a' argument to the stats.php request URL allows
					you to specify that you want the output to be sent
					as an HTTP attachment.  This has the effect in most
					web browsers of prompting the user for a location to
					download the file to or open the file up in an
					associated application if MIME types are configured
					correctly.

					To have output sent as an attachment, use 'a=1' as
					an argument to the stats.php request URL - for
					example:

                    http://example.com/torrentflux-b4rt/stats.php?t=server&a=1

					This request URL would send out the server
					statistics as an HTTP attachment, prompting the user
					to save the file to disk or open it in an external
					application.

				Sending compressed stats.php output

					The 'c' argument to the stats.php request URL allows
					you to specify that the output from stats.php should
					be compressed when sending.  Most modern web
					browsers automatically 'deflate' the compressed
					content on receipt so it's human readable.

					Compression saves bandwidth at the cost of adding
					some small additional CPU resource cost on the
					server.

					To have output compressed when sending, use 'c=1' as
					an argument to the stats.php request URL - for
					example:

                    http://example.com/torrentflux-b4rt/stats.php?t=server&c=1

					This request URL would compress the server
					statistics output before sending it out.

					Tip:
					----
					The level of compression to use can be configured on
					the [TODO_LINK:admin.stats 'the Admin Ops,
					Configuring stats.php page'].

                Configuring stats.php

                    A number of options can be configured to control the
                    way the stats.php script operates.  Refer to the
                    [TODO_LINK:admin.stats 'Admin Ops, configuring
                    stats.php section of the manual.]
