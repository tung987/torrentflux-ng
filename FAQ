/**********************************************************************
Torrentflux-b4rt compatibility with other operating systems
**********************************************************************/

Q.	Will torrentflux-b4rt run on a Linksys NSLU2 'slug'?

A.	There are reports from users that torrentflux-b4rt will run on the
	slug with the OpenSlug operating system:

	http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/OpenSlug/HomePage

	However, a version of 'ps' must be installed that works with
	torrentflux-b4rt such as the procps ipkg / package.  See this post
	for more details:

/**********************************************************************
Fluxd
**********************************************************************/

Q.	I get the following error when trying to start fluxd:

	Error : initializing FluxDB : loglevel not defined

	What does it mean and how can I solve the problem?

A.	This error indicates that your PHP commandline binary (php-cli) is
	not built with support for the database you're using.  You can check
	the supported modules you have built into your php-cli binary by
	issuing the command 'php -m' in a shell:

    root@users /root# php -m
    [PHP Modules]
    mysql
    pcre
    session
    sockets

	These 3 modules listed above - mysql (or one of the other supported
	database types), pcre, session and sockets - are all required to run
	Fluxd correctly.  If you don't see these, you should reinstall your
	php-cli binary with support for the missing options.

	Notes:
	======
	It may be the case that you have installed php-cli with support for
	all the above options but for some reason the php.ini file has not
	been modified to actually enable the extensions correctly.  Check
	that your php.ini file has the following in it:

	extension=/path/to/mysql.so
	extension=/path/to/pcre.so
	extension=/path/to/session.so
	extension=/path/to/sockets.so

	where '/path/to' is the path to the extension libs.

	Another useful troubleshooting tip for this problem is to run
	'php -i' on the commandline and search for 'ini' in the output:

	root@users /root# php -i | grep ini
	Configuration File (php.ini) Path => /usr/local/etc/php.ini
	Scan this dir for additional .ini files => /usr/local/etc/php
	additional .ini files parsed => /usr/local/etc/php/extensions.ini
	phpini => /usr/local/etc/php.ini

	This gives you an idea where all the config files for your php
	binary are sourced from so that you can check and confirm everything
	is in place.


/**********************************************************************
Transmission
**********************************************************************/

Q.	How do I install the modified Torrentflux-b4rt version of
	Transmission on BSD (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/etc)?

A.	The BSD operating systems use 'make' as part of the base operating
	system to perform various operations such as updating the base
	system, installing 3rd party software/ports and other stuff.  As a
	result, running 'make' to build/install the modified transmission
	client on BSD will cause problems such as:

	[3:58:30] root@users# make
	"mk/common.mk", line 9: Missing dependency operator
	"mk/common.mk", line 11: Missing dependency operator
	"mk/common.mk", line 14: Need an operator
	"mk/common.mk", line 16: Need an operator
	"mk/common.mk", line 17: Need an operator
	"mk/common.mk", line 19: Missing dependency operator
	Error expanding embedded variable.

	The solution is to use a different version of make such as GNU's
	gmake.  This utility should be available from the ports tree for
	your OS.

	Once you have gmake installed, run the following commands to
	build and install the modified transmission client for use with
	torrentflux-b4rt:

	# Change into the dir containing the modified transmission client:
	root@users /root# cd ~tfbdev/svn/tf-b4rt/trunk/clients/transmission/

	# Set env variables for CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS and CFLAGS.
	# Note: this command should be all on one line, remove '\' below:
	root@users /home/tfbdev/svn/tf-b4rt/trunk/clients/transmission# \
    setenv CXXFLAGS -I/usr/local/include \
    && setenv LDFLAGS "-L/usr/local/lib -lgnugetopt" \
    && setenv CFLAGS -I/usr/local/include
	root@users /home/tfbdev/svn/tf-b4rt/trunk/clients/transmission# \

	# Finally, configure, build and install the client
	# Again, note this is on one line, remove the '\':
	root@users /home/tfbdev/svn/tf-b4rt/trunk/clients/transmission# \
    ./configure && gmake && gmake install
